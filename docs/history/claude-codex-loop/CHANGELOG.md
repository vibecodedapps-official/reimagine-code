# Changelog

## 0.10.0 - 2026-10-02

### Added

- The optional `parent` and `links` keys on issue tickets, gated on cca 0.3.0 or later.
  Final report handling reads closing PRs with
  `gh issue view <URL> --json closedByPullRequestsReferences`, which needs gh 2.73.0 or
  later, and the parent with a GraphQL `parent` query, always sent to the issue's host
  with `--hostname`. File and text inputs and raised tickets get neither key. A failed
  read writes no key, never `links: none`.
- Acceptance items 177 to 181 cover the keys, a successful empty read, a missing cca,
  each read failing on its own, and the version gate's numeric and unparsable cases.

### Changed

- `run.md` records each issue input's parent and closing PRs, a failed read with its
  error line, or that the cca version gate skipped the reads.
- The report's `Handoff:` line names a failed read and a gated omission, with the
  installed cca version or that none was found.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-10-01

### Added

- A handoff for the cca plugin, `.ccl/<run-id>/handoff.md`, written from the run's own
  record whenever the run has a commit of its own from Step 7.1, in any terminal state.
  A run with no commit writes none and the report says why. The writer's rules are in
  `skills/ccl/handoff.md`.
- An audit manifest, `.ccl/<run-id>/cca-manifest.json`, beside the handoff: each
  repository's bundle with its PR, or its branch and base, and the handoff's path.
- Two report header lines: `Handoff:` gives the path or why none was written, and `Audit:`
  suggests `/cca:audit` on the manifest when the work has more than one bundle, more
  than one ticket, or 500 or more changed lines. The bounds are a suggestion.
- cca pairing requires cca 0.2.0 or later, the first with `handoff.sh`. With an older cca
  the files are written by the same shapes, cca's check is not run, and the report says
  so and does not suggest `/cca:handoff`.
- A ticket's `verified` lists only the passed Step 6 checks of its first bundle's
  repository, each naming the bundle and the directory. A bundle's `base` is always
  `<selected remote>/<base branch>`, since cca refreshes only a remote-tracking base.

### Changed

- Step 0.5's issue fetch adds `assignees` and `milestone` to its `--json` fields.
- `run.md` gains a decision record: the choice, its reason, the options weighed, who
  decided, and where it was published.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- The branch question suggests a remote branch when its name shares a stem with another
  repository's suggested or explicit branch, not only when one name is a string prefix
  of the other. The stem is the longest common prefix, cut back to its last `/`, `-`,
  `_`, or `.` unless it is a whole name; it must not stop at a `/` and must not be a
  prefix of the default branch, so a shared directory alone and the default branch are
  never suggested. Sibling names such as `feature/user/2026.09-migration-fixes` and
  `feature/user/2026.09-migration-heart` matched under neither prefix test, so in a live
  run a repository whose `HEAD` was on an unrelated branch got that branch as its only
  suggestion, and a plain `yes` would have continued it.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-09-30

Requires codex-lite 0.8.0 or later, as in 0.7.0. `--cwd` reviews of additional
repositories need codex-lite 0.9.0 or later; below it the 0.7.0 patch rule stays.

### Changed

- Breaking: Step 1 is renumbered. The repository gate moves from 1.4 to 1.2, claim
  verification is 1.3, drift is 1.4, buildable status is 1.5, and tiers are 1.6. Every
  cross-reference follows.
- Breaking: `--repo` takes `<path>[@<branch>]`. `@<branch>` names the branch that
  repository continues, and the primary needs no `--continue` for it, so one run may
  create a branch in the primary and continue another elsewhere. A value that is an
  existing directory is a path and is never split, so a path containing `@` still works.
  The command checks only the branch's form. A branch that is missing on that
  repository's remote fails preflight in Step 0.2, never created. Each repository has
  its own branch state, `new` or `continue <branch>`, and the rule that every repository
  uses one branch name is gone. In 0.7.0 an additional repository whose remote lacked the
  `--continue` branch created it under that name; now such a repository with no
  `@<branch>` is `new`, gets the name the naming rule produces, and meets the collision
  check.
- Breaking: a `HEAD` that is not at the base commit on a clean checkout that continues a
  branch becomes a switch question instead of a preflight failure. With consent the run
  runs `git switch`, or a fast-forward when the local branch is behind the remote, also
  from a `HEAD` detached at the remote head, and records the previous `HEAD` per
  repository in `run.md`. When a worktree run is predicted, the session's files are not
  touched, because a checkout would be refused when a flagged file differs between the
  commits; the run asks only to detach the session in place when it is on the branch
  and to fast-forward a behind local branch without checking it out, and the worktree,
  created at the base commit, is what the plan reads. The checks rerun after the
  reply, before any switch, and a change ends in `blocked`. A divergent local branch, a
  dirty tree, and a branch checked out in another worktree still fail preflight.
- Breaking: up to three new in-session questions make a run attended: credentials,
  repositories, and branches, plus the switch question for an explicit continuation. Step
  0.1 predicts the credentials question and lists the switch question as one that may
  be asked, without fetching before the statement is printed. The repository and
  branch questions are listed as "may prompt at Step 1.2". Each question follows Step
  3.5's mechanics: a clear answer continues, anything else ends the run in the terminal
  state the question names, the wait is outside the run budget, and mutable state is
  rechecked after the reply. The credentials, repository, and branch questions end in
  `stopped`; Step 3.5 keeps `plan-only` for a non-approval.
- A `blocked` report for unnamed writable checkouts adds, when neither `--branch` nor
  `--continue` was given, a block that says how to continue existing branches and lists
  each checkout's `HEAD` as the run saw it. No branch is chosen for the user.
- A `prepared` run gives `git push <remote> <its branch>` for each repository with a
  diff.
- With codex-lite 0.9.0 or later, each additional repository with a diff is reviewed with
  `codex-lite:review --cwd <absolute path>` in a fresh thread, and a follow-up or CI
  repair for it resumes that thread. The patch files are still written, because the Claude substitute
  reviewer and the `--no-codex` fallback read them.

### Added

- Credential scan of the inputs before Step 0.1. A line with a credential key
  (`password`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`, and the like), an AWS access key id, a PEM
  header, or a block under a credentials heading asks "keep or drop". `keep` writes them
  to `inputs.md` and forwards them to Codex. `drop` replaces each value with `<redacted:
  key>` in every artifact and Codex request the run writes. A native `codex-lite:review`
  reads the repository's own diff, so after `drop` the same scan runs over that diff
  before each native review, and a match reviews through `codex-lite:ask` with a
  redacted patch file in a fresh thread. The scan is a guard for common shapes, not a
  guarantee.
- Adoption of repositories from prose by question at Step 1.2. A writable checkout the
  inputs ask to change and `--repo` did not name is offered as an adoption, and a path to
  a file inside a checkout counts through its parent directory. `yes` or a
  subset of paths enters Multi-repo mode; anything else ends in `stopped`, and a flagged
  path still missing after a subset ends in `blocked`. A worktree primary or a dirty
  adopted repository ends in `blocked`. Silent adoption stays rejected.
- A branch question asked once at adoption for every repository with no explicit branch
  state, with suggestions from each checkout's `HEAD` and from remote branches that share
  a name prefix with another repository's branch. The reply decides, and each chosen
  branch is validated against its remote.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-09-30

Requires codex-lite 0.8.0 or later, for `codex-lite:implement`. 0.7.0 is no longer enough.

### Changed

- Codex implements every slice by default, through `codex-lite:implement`: `gpt-6-luna`
  at low, `gpt-6.1-sol` at medium and high, and `gpt-6-astra` at xhigh and max. The
  orchestrator still reviews each slice in Step 4. At high, xhigh, and max a slice that
  meets the existing Implementer choice criteria (a risk floor trigger, more than eight
  files, or a new module, type, interface, or rule section that another file cites) goes
  to an Opus agent instead. The plan records "codex" or the criterion for each slice at
  every tier. Sonnet is never chosen at the plan. It is the fallback: under
  `--no-codex`, when Codex is unavailable at Step 0.6, when a Codex implementer call
  returns `failed` or no status line twice in a row, and when an Opus call errors.
- Breaking: low tier now has a final review. Step 5 runs at every tier with a Codex
  reviewer and the Claude `code-review` skill. A run that needs the skill and cannot find
  it ends in `blocked` when Step 5 starts, so low and medium runs now need it. A
  plan-only run still does not. The low and medium run budgets of 120 minutes now include
  Step 5.
- Breaking: the high cell carries the trigger. At high tier the final review is
  `gpt-6-astra` with `code-review high` when a trigger was present at the estimate or is
  in the diff after Step 4, else `gpt-6.1-sol` with `code-review medium`. A medium run
  that rises to high always has a trigger in the diff, so it gets the trigger cell. The
  xhigh and max cells no longer depend on the trigger: `gpt-6-astra`, with
  `code-review high` at xhigh and `code-review xhigh` at max.
- Breaking: a worktree run is allowed at every tier. The gates at Step 0.3, Step 1.5, and
  Step 4.5 are gone. The Claude slot of a worktree run is the Opus subagent that
  `multi-repo.md` defines for additional repositories, recorded in `run.md` and named in
  the report as a substitute, not a swap, because the `code-review` skill reviews only the
  session's checkout.
- A Step 6 check-failure fix goes through a Step 5 round with every reviewer the stage
  has, at every tier, low included, within Step 5's cap. A CI repair at every tier uses
  the Step 5 Codex thread when one exists, else `codex-lite:review --base <base-commit>`,
  plus the Claude reviewer, and each cycle keeps its one extra review round.
- A fix round for a Codex slice, in Step 4.3 or Step 5.3, is a fresh `implement` call with
  the findings and the slice's current diff, because resume is read-only in codex-lite.
  `SendMessage` continues Opus and Sonnet implementers only.
- Codex calls stay one at a time per session, so independent Codex slices run in series
  and never inside a Workflow. Opus and Sonnet slices may still run in parallel.
- Reviewer and implementer Codex calls have separate budgets and fallbacks. Reviewer
  calls keep the Codex budget, capped at 60 minutes, and the `opus` and `fable` then
  `opus` fallbacks. An implementer call takes the smaller of the subagent budget and the
  remaining run budget, capped at 3600 seconds because codex-lite refuses a larger
  `--timeout`, and falls back to `sonnet` only. The cap and the value passed are logged
  in `run.md`. Opus and Sonnet agents keep the full subagent budget.
- Codex has no network. Dependencies the plan adds are installed by the orchestrator in
  Step 3.7, after the baseline checks and the ask-first rule and before any implementer
  starts, and their manifest and lockfile edits are reviewed in Step 5 with the rest of
  the diff. A slice's checks that need the network run in the orchestrator after the
  implementer returns, and a failure goes back as a finding.
- A worktree run, or an additional repository in Multi-repo mode, passes `--cwd
  <checkout>` to `implement`, and the request names files by absolute path or carries
  their content. The relative-path rule for requests applies to reviewer calls only.

### Added

- Failure rules for a Codex implementer call. A `failed` call or one with no status line
  may have written part of the slice, so the previous call must have returned its output
  before a retry or the Sonnet fallback. A call whose output never arrives is a budget
  expiry, and output that says Codex may still be running ends the run in `blocked`, with
  no other writer started on that checkout. On Windows a `failed` call, or one with no
  status line, is not retried and gets no fallback, and ends in `blocked` naming the
  possible surviving process. A Bash tool result with no `status:` line is output that
  never arrived. A path the footer lists outside the slice is reverted before the retry.
  A `refused` status ends the run in `blocked`, except a refusal from the host's write
  sandbox ("implement was not run:"), which swaps the slice to `sonnet` and marks Codex
  implementation unavailable for the run; a `timeout` status is a budget expiry.
  The threshold stays two failures in a row.
- The Skill tool entry `codex-lite:implement` in the skill's tools, and the minimum
  codex-lite version of 0.8.0 in the Step 0.6 check. `implement` is invocable by Claude,
  which weakens codex-lite's guarantee that writes are gated on a typed command. In a
  session in default permission mode the Skill call still prompts.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-09-30

### Added

- `--continue <branch>` on `/ccl:run` and `/ccl:plan`. The run takes the remote branch
  head as the base, switches to the branch instead of creating one, pushes to it without
  force, and comments on its open PR instead of opening a second one, or opens a PR when
  none exists. PR references stay rejected as inputs. The value is rejected when it starts
  with `-`, has a character other than letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `/`, and `-`, or fails
  `git check-ref-format --branch`. A branch checked out in another worktree fails
  preflight. `HEAD` of the session's checkout must be at the base commit, on the branch or
  detached at it, or preflight fails with the command to run, which is `git merge
  --ff-only <remote>/<branch>`, `git switch <branch>`, or `git switch --detach
  <remote>/<branch>`, by where the session is. The default branch is rejected as the
  value. A plan-only run records a differing local branch, a branch checked out in another
  worktree, and the pull request cases instead of failing, but it still needs `HEAD` at
  the remote head, for example detached with `git switch --detach <remote>/<branch>`, and
  then records the differing local branch. A `--no-publish` run also records the closed,
  merged, and several-open pull request cases instead of failing. A repository whose
  remote lacks the branch creates it under the same name in Multi-repo mode. A PR opened
  for a continued branch says how many earlier commits the run did not review. The pull
  request list reads open PRs first, up to 100, and the rest only when none from this
  repository is open; a list that may be cut off by forks with the same branch name is a
  pull request failure. After a `--confirm-plan` yes and before the first push the PRs
  are read again, and a PR retargeted to another base branch ends in `blocked`. A
  `prepared` run with an open PR gives `gh pr comment <n> --body-file <absolute path>` in
  place of `gh pr create`. With `--no-publish` and an incomplete list, several open PRs,
  or only closed or merged ones, it names them and gives neither command. (#16)
- `--confirm-plan` and Step 3.5. Once the plan is final and reverified, the run asks once.
  A clear yes continues, a requested change is one more Step 3 round, so an open blocking
  objection at the cap ends in `blocked`, and anything else ends in plan-only. The wait is
  left out of the run budget. After a yes, the clean-tree check reruns before Step 3.7.2,
  with the local-branch, worktree, and `HEAD` checks under `--continue`, and so does the
  skip-worktree comparison, where a hidden edit not recorded at Step 0.3 is a failure. A
  failure ends in `blocked`. A requested change with no round left ends in `stopped`, and the
  report gives the change. (#17)
- A Step 1 check for writable checkouts named in the task but not passed with `--repo`.
  The run ends in `blocked` with the rerun command instead of adopting Multi-repo mode
  from prose. The check covers any writable checkout not listed with `--repo`, and the
  rerun command adds one `--repo` for each missing checkout. (#18)
- A rule for an additional repository with skip-worktree files that differ from `HEAD`.
  The run continues, and the report names the files as the local state its checks ran
  against. No slice may edit such a path, because the edit would be invisible to review
  and the commit: a plan that needs one ends in `blocked` at Step 2. (#18)

### Changed

- The worktree run, Multi-repo mode, and CI watch rules moved from `SKILL.md` to
  `worktree.md`, `multi-repo.md`, and `ci-watch.md`, read only when the run takes that
  path. The move commit changed no rule, only pointers and cross-references. The later
  0.6.0 rule changes in those files are the ones listed in this section. The move cut the
  lines a default single-repository GitHub run reads through Step 6 from 1,309 to 1,115.
  (#20)

### Fixed

- Every `code-review` pass now targets `<base-commit>...HEAD`. A bare base commit made
  it review only that commit and skip the uncommitted task. Verified live on 2026-09-30
  in the Step 5 and CI repair states. (#15)
- Every remote branch check queries the exact ref `refs/heads/<branch>`. A bare name
  matches any ref whose path ends in it, which could report a missing branch as present.
  This includes the new-branch collision check in Step 3.7.2. (#16)
- In Multi-repo mode each repository's PR body is `.ccl/<run-id>/pr-body-<slug>.md` in
  the primary, passed by absolute path to every `gh` body call for an additional
  repository. The relative path that `gh pr create` used before would not resolve from
  that repository's checkout. (#18)
- Time logging runs `date` only at step headings and around timed calls, in one UTC
  format. Every logged time is copied from the `date` output, not recalled or derived.
  (#19) Elapsed time is the Step 0 start to the latest recorded time, less each Step 3.5
  wait. The worktree install step is a timed call under the check budget.
- The CI watch reads the PR again at each poll and ends in `blocked` when its base branch
  differs from the one the run recorded, because the required checks it read belong to
  the old base branch.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- The `gpt-6-sol` reviewer slot now uses `gpt-6.1-sol`, released 2026-09-29. Every cell
  that named `gpt-6-sol` keeps its place in the tier table; only the model id changes.
  `gpt-6-astra` cells and the Opus fallback are unchanged.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Codex availability no longer depends on the session's skill list. It is decided from
  `codex --version` and the installed codex-lite version, 0.7.0 or later. A Skill call for
  `codex-lite:ask` or `codex-lite:review` that errors because the skill is not listed
  counts as a `failed` call: retry once, then swap, with the reason recorded. (#7)
- Implementers match the repository's line endings for every new file, and Step 4.3
  checks new files with `git ls-files --eol` before review. (#8)
- Independent slices run in parallel either as one Workflow or as parallel Agent calls
  in one message. The orchestrator picks and logs the choice in `run.md`. Agent calls
  are the default when review rounds are expected, because they can be continued. (#9)
- The run budget default is by tier: 120 minutes at low and medium, 240 at high, 360 at
  xhigh and max. `--run-budget <minutes>`, else `.ccl.json` `timeouts.run`, overrides it,
  and an explicit instruction in the session can replace it. The report names the budget
  in force and its source. (#10)
- A dropped call, one that returns no result and no explicit denial, is not a denial. A
  dropped read-only call is retried once, serially. A dropped write is checked before any
  retry. A clean tree with skip-worktree or assume-unchanged files that differ from
  `HEAD` runs in a detached worktree beside the checkout, below high tier and
  not in Multi-repo mode. This is a narrow use of the deferred `--worktree` feature, not
  the feature. (#11)

### Added

- Host detection in Step 0. On a host other than GitHub the run accepts only file and
  text inputs, runs Steps 0 to 6, and ends in `prepared` with a handoff to the host's own
  tooling. A full Azure DevOps path is out of scope. (#4)
- Multi-repo mode: a repeatable `--repo <path>` flag names additional writable
  checkouts. Each repository gets its own base commit, branch, baseline, checks, and PR,
  with sibling links in each PR body. Every repository must be on the same host. (#5)
- The `prepared` terminal state, and the `--no-publish` flag on `/ccl:run`. A run whose
  Step 7 is withheld before any push, by the flag, by a non-GitHub host, or by a denied
  Step 7 action, ends in `prepared` with the commands to publish. (#6)

## 0.4.0 - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Every tier reviews the plan with Codex. Low tier no longer skips Step 3.
- Only low tier skips the final review. Medium now gets a `gpt-6-sol` diff review.
- At high tier and above the built-in `code-review` skill reviews the diff beside Codex,
  at `medium` for high, `high` for xhigh, and `xhigh` for max. It is a fixed slot: never
  swapped, untouched by `--no-codex`, and a run that needs it and cannot find it ends in
  `blocked`. Low, medium, and plan-only runs do not need it.
- Two cells follow the risk trigger: the high tier plan review is `gpt-6-astra` when the
  change has a risk floor trigger at the estimate, else `gpt-6-sol`; the xhigh final
  review is `gpt-6-astra` when a trigger was present at the estimate or is in the diff
  after Step 4, else `gpt-6-sol`. Xhigh plan review is now always `gpt-6-astra`. The high
  tier final review stays `gpt-6-sol`.
- A Step 5 round at high tier and above is both passes over the same diff, under one
  shared cap of 3. Findings from both are merged and fixed in one batch. Step 5 no longer
  has a post-cap orchestrator fix, and the third round fixes nothing: a blocking finding
  there ends in `blocked` and a non-blocking one is deferred.
- Every Claude review pass is given the base commit as its target, so it reviews the same
  base-to-working-tree diff Codex does. Without a target the skill picks its own range and
  can include unrelated commits when local `main` is behind the fetched base.
- CI repair and Step 6 repair at medium tier and above go through a Step 5 round with every
  reviewer the stage has. Low tier keeps the orchestrator's own review.
- The reviewer fallback follows the Codex model: `gpt-6-sol` to Opus, `gpt-6-astra` to
  Fable then Opus, at any tier.
- Decisions Part 7 records the reasons. Part 3 items 9 and 11 and Part 5 item 5 are
  superseded; Part 2 item 10, Part 4 item 9, and Part 5 items 3 and 7 are qualified.
- Acceptance items 4, 27, 29, 36, 38, 41, 42, and 44 change, and items 55 to 61 are new.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- Slice count is now a plan property at every tier. A plan has one or more slices that
  share no file: independent slices run in parallel in one Workflow, dependent slices run
  in order. `xhigh` and `max` are still sized by how many areas the change spans, but that
  now sets review depth only.
- At `xhigh` and `max` the implementer for each slice is Sonnet or Opus, chosen by the
  written criteria in `tiers.md`. If an Opus call returns a tool error, the slice falls
  back to Sonnet and the swap is recorded. Low, medium, and high still use Sonnet.
- Budget consequence: each slice keeps its own cap of 3 rounds and the per-call subagent
  timeout, and the run budget still bounds the whole run. A high plan with three slices
  therefore has three independent round caps where 0.2.0 had one.
- Decision Part 5 item 4 is superseded by Part 6 in `docs/decisions.md`.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-28

### Changed

- Five effort tiers, `low|medium|high|xhigh|max`, replace the three. Plan review runs at
  medium and above (`gpt-6-astra` at max, `gpt-6-sol` otherwise). The final review runs at
  high and above (same models). Low, medium, and high plans have one slice built by one
  Sonnet agent; xhigh and max plans may have several, one Sonnet agent per slice, in
  parallel when independent. Compared with 0.1.0, `--effort high` now gets `gpt-6-sol`
  reviews instead of `gpt-6-astra` and a single implementer, and `--effort medium` no
  longer gets a final review; the old high is closest to the new `max`.
- The Codex round review during implementation is removed at every tier. The orchestrator
  is the only reviewer during implementation.
- The risk floor now targets high, the middle tier. `--effort low` and `--effort medium`
  are refused on a floored task; `xhigh` and `max` are above the floor and honored.
- Medium tier no longer has a final review. It keeps the plan review, and Step 6 still
  runs the full check set.
- The estimate rule has five buckets. Low, medium, and high are sized from behavioral
  risk; xhigh and max from how many areas that share no file the change spans.
- After implementation only the risk floor is applied to the diff again. The estimate
  rule is not, so a run never rises above high after Step 4.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-28

First release.

### Added

- Plugin `ccl`, prompt-only: markdown and one JSON manifest, no hooks and no scripts.
- Commands `/ccl:run` and `/ccl:plan`. `/ccl:plan` is `/ccl:run --plan-only`. Both run
  build mode and share one orchestrator skill.
- Inputs: same-repo issue URLs or `#n` numbers (bundled into one PR), an ad-hoc
  description, and a file of notes. Pull request references are rejected.
- Flags: `--effort low|medium|high`, `--plan-only`, `--no-codex`, `--branch <name>`.
- Effort tiers with an estimate rule, a risk floor for auth, permission, schema,
  migration, row-level security, data access, and public API changes, and a tier
  re-evaluation against the actual diff.
- Steps 0 to 7: preflight, review and verify, plan, plan review, execution setup,
  implement, final review, checks, publish. Publish commits, pushes, opens one PR,
  watches CI with up to 3 repair cycles, and comments on each source issue.
- Codex review through `codex-lite` 0.7.0 or later, with full model ids `gpt-6-sol` and
  `gpt-6-astra`, a `--timeout` on every call, and explicit thread ids on follow-ups.
- Claude fallbacks for every reviewer stage, named in the report. A fallback never
  removes a stage.
- Approval scope: what the run does without asking, what it always asks before, and a
  rule that repo and user ask-first rules win.
- Terminal states `done`, `plan-only`, `blocked`, and `stopped`, each with a written
  report, except that a failure before the run directory exists prints the report and
  writes nothing.
- Round caps of 3, per-call time budgets, and a 4 hour run-wide budget, overridable in
  `.ccl.json`.
- `.ccl.json` with `commit`, `checks`, and `timeouts`.
- Templates for the final report and the PR body.
- `docs/decisions.md` (why each rule exists) and `docs/acceptance.md` (hand-run checks).
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so the repo can be added as a marketplace and the
  plugin installed with `/plugin install ccl@vibecodedapps-claude-codex-loop`.

### Known limits

- Default permission mode prompts at every Codex call. Unattended runs need auto mode,
  or `--no-codex` plus allow rules for the `git` and `gh` writes.
- Some mechanics are unverified until the acceptance checks are run by hand: the
  command-to-skill handoff, whether Codex reviews files marked with `git add -N`,
  whether a command can pre-approve another plugin's Bash call, and the Fable model
  override on the Agent tool.

### Deferred to 0.2

- Repair mode, `/ccl:pr <n>`, which fixes an existing pull request.
- `--merge`, which merges after CI is green and cleans up the branch.
- `--worktree`, which runs the loop in a new worktree.
