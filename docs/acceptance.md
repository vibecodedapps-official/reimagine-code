# Acceptance

Hand-run checks for the suite. Each milestone adds its items. An item is
`N. **Title.** Setup: ... Command: ... Expected: ... Rerun when ...`, and an item not yet
run says "Not yet run." Runs before cutover use scratch profiles: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and
`CODEX_HOME` pointing at directories outside the repo, so the author's own setup does not
change.

The source repos' acceptance files are kept under `docs/history/`. Items from them that
name a plugin are rerun under the new names and recorded here.

## Items

1. **Bridge in a scratch profile.** Setup: scratch `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `CODEX_HOME`,
   `recode` installed from this repository's catalog, and a scratch git repository.
   Command: `/recode:setup`, then `/recode:ask` with a short question, then
   `/recode:implement` from a test skill that asks for a one-line edit. Expected: setup
   reports the Codex version and login, and allow rules that name the
   `recode-reimagine-code` data directory and the installed `recode` path; ask prints
   Codex's answer; implement edits the scratch repository and its footer shows the
   change. Covers R9 and R15. Rerun when a bridge command, the setup report, or the data
   directory changes. Run 2026-10-03; see the record.
2. **codex-lite items under the new names.** Setup: as each item says, in scratch
   profiles. Command: items 1, 5, 8, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, and 19 of
   `docs/history/codex-lite-cc/acceptance.md`, the items that name the plugin or its
   variables, with `/codex-lite:` read as `/recode:` and `CODEX_LITE_` as `RECODE_`.
   Item 15, the Windows install, runs on the Windows work machine with R53. List drawn
   2026-10-03 at the start of M2. Expected: each item's own result. Rerun when that
   file's own conditions say. Run 2026-10-03; see the record.
3. **House rules in a scratch profile.** Setup: scratch `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` whose
   `CLAUDE.md` holds text of its own, scratch `CODEX_HOME` holding an `AGENTS.md`, and
   `recode` installed from this repository's catalog. Command: `/recode:rules`, choose
   the options, and accept each target; start a new session and ask it to quote a rule
   from the block; then `/recode:rules --remove` and accept each target. Repeat with no
   Codex home. Expected: each target's diff is shown and asked about separately; the new
   session quotes the rule; after removal each file equals its backup byte for byte; with
   no Codex home the Codex target is reported as skipped and no directory is created.
   Covers R33, R38, R41, and R42. Rerun when `rules.mjs`, the rules command, or a rules
   file changes. Not yet run.
4. **Staleness notice and decline.** Setup: as item 3, with this block in `CLAUDE.md`,
   whose digest matches its body: begin line
   `<!-- recode:house-rules begin version=0.0.1 options=core join=none digest=6d3e610aaf815551 -->`,
   then the line `old rules`, then `<!-- recode:house-rules end -->`. Command: start an
   interactive session; then `/recode:rules` and decline the Claude change; then start
   another session. Expected: the first session shows one line naming the file and
   `/recode:rules`; after the decline the next session shows nothing. Covers R43 and
   R45. Rerun when `suite.mjs` or the hooks change. Not yet run.
5. **Output style and old plugins.** Setup: as item 3, with `codex-lite` also installed
   from its old marketplace. Command: `/output-style`, then `/recode:setup`. Expected: the
   picker lists `recode:Concise Plain`, and replies follow it once chosen; setup's
   output ends with `claude plugin uninstall codex-lite@vibecodedapps-codex-lite`, and
   nothing is uninstalled. Covers R16 and R46. Rerun when the style or the old-plugin
   list changes. Not yet run.

## Record of runs

Each entry gives the date, the machine, the Claude Code, Codex, and Node versions, the
items run, and the result.

### 2026-10-03: M2, recode 0.1.0

macOS 27.0, Claude Code 2.1.284, codex-cli 0.159.2, Node 26.4.0. The scratch profile was
`~/.cache/recode-acceptance/`, with a copy of the Codex config and login as its
`CODEX_HOME`. recode was installed from the GitHub marketplace at `feat/bridge`, commit
6674c3c, and was byte for byte the branch's `plugins/recode/`. Every run was a headless
`claude -p` session or the entry script. No interactive session ran, because the scratch
profile opens first-run onboarding and a login screen.

- **Always-on cost.** `claude plugin details` reported about 1,190 tokens, and R8 allows
  1,300.
- **Item 1 passed.** `/recode:setup` reported Codex 0.159.2, the login, a proven
  `workspace-write` sandbox, and rules naming `recode-reimagine-code` and the installed
  `recode/0.1.0` path. `/recode:ask` answered. A test skill's `implement` edited a
  worktree and the footer showed both changed files.
- **Item 2, codex-lite items under the new names:**
  - 1 passed in auto mode: the request and a denied flag name arrived byte for byte, the
    Bash command was the constant one, and `--base topic/$(id)` reached git literally. In
    default mode the Write is refused as "a sensitive file", as since codex-lite 0.2.0.
  - 5 passed: a missing probe runtime and a probe target inside the working directory each
    made `setup` and `do` refuse. Windows parts not run.
  - 8 passed: the rules parse as JSON, and the Bash rule runs only the installed path.
  - 11 passed: plain words reached `review --base main` and `ask` with no approvals, and a
    plain-words `do` made no call.
  - 12 passed in part. A fresh session with an unread leftover read it, rewrote it, and
    succeeded. A resumed session counts its own leftover as read, so the quit-and-resume
    route no longer reaches step 2. The `do` case failed; see the first defect.
  - 16 passed, checked in debug logs and transcripts: one routing note per plain-words
    prompt, none for a typed `/recode:do` or a project command naming Codex, and Claude
    converged after Codex's answer in the same turn. `--model astra` reached Codex, which
    refused the model for this account.
  - 17 passed: both resume forms reused the thread read-only and Codex remembered it. A
    bare `--resume` in a fresh session was refused before Codex ran.
  - 18 passed in part: the 1 s and 30 s timeouts, typed, model-invoked, and resumed, all
    ended `status: timeout`, and the Bash-tool cut-off printed no `status:` line. The
    status line in a background-task notification was not run. See the second defect.
  - 19 passed in part: the skill's three lines reached the request file exactly, the run
    edited only the worktree, and the three refusals and the read-only resume held. The
    interactive default-mode prompt was not run; headless, the Skill call was gated as
    "Execute skill: recode:implement".
  - 15 is Windows only and was not run.
- **Defect: a leftover request can reach Codex through `do`.** With an unread leftover, in
  2 of 5 runs Claude sent the Write and the script's Bash call in one message. The Write
  failed with "File has not been read yet", the pre-approved Bash call ran anyway, and
  Codex did the leftover task. The command text is identical to codex-lite 0.9.0 after the
  rename, which batched in 0 of 4 runs, so the defect is probably inherited.
- **Defect: a timeout leaves Codex's shell commands running.** codex-cli 0.159.2 starts
  each command in its own process group, so stopping Codex's group misses it. An
  `implement --timeout 25` running `sleep 40 && echo late > late.txt` printed a clean tree
  and `status: timeout`, then wrote `late.txt`. codex-lite 0.9.0 did the same in a run of
  the same day, so the defect is inherited.
- **Observed, not judged:** a timed-out `ask` saves no thread, so a bare `--resume` right
  after it is refused. In one default-mode run Claude ran the Bash step after a failed
  Write; the script refused with "no request file", so nothing reached Codex.
