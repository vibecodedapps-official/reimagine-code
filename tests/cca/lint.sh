#!/bin/sh
# lint.sh: static checks for the cca plugin files.
#
# Usage: sh tests/cca/lint.sh [root]
#
# root defaults to $LINT_ROOT, else plugins/cca in the repository that holds this
# script. Use it to lint a copy, for example a copy of the plugin with Edit added to
# an agent's tools, which must fail.
#
# File list: inside a git work tree, `git ls-files --cached --others
# --exclude-standard` run from root (tracked files plus new files that are not
# ignored, so files a change adds count before they are staged), keeping only files
# that exist. Outside a git work tree, every file under root except .git/.
#
# Checks:
# - commands/audit.md, resume.md, act.md, handoff.md exist; every commands/*.md has
#   frontmatter keys description, argument-hint, allowed-tools.
# - agents/digester.md, mapper.md, auditor.md, adversary.md, merger.md exist; every
#   agents/*.md has frontmatter keys name (equal to the file name), description,
#   model, tools; every tools entry (YAML list, comma string, or [flow list]) is one
#   of Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write; and no Edit or NotebookEdit token appears
#   anywhere in the file.
# - skills/cca/SKILL.md has frontmatter keys name, description, and the line
#   `user-invocable: false`; it names each stage file below by path, and every
#   stages/*.md path it mentions exists under skills/cca/.
# - skills/cca/handoff.md, skills/cca/live.md, and skills/cca/work-items.md exist.
# - Every scripts/<name>.sh path that a file under skills/ or commands/ mentions
#   exists under skills/cca/scripts/.
# - .claude-plugin/plugin.json parses as JSON (node, else python3, else skipped with
#   a note). The catalog that lists the plugin is checked by tools/lint.mjs.
# - No file under .claude-plugin/, commands/, skills/, agents/, docs/, or README.md
#   mentions the three planning documents that preceded the implementation. The three
#   documents themselves are not scanned, so the check holds before and after they
#   are removed.
# - No file under agents/, skills/, commands/ mentions `advisor`, except a line that
#   forbids it: one matching (no|never|not)( use)?( the)? `?advisor, any case, such as
#   "no advisor", "never the `advisor`", or "do not use the advisor".
# - Every gh read in a file under agents/, skills/, or commands/ names its host. In a
#   backtick span, a `gh pr <sub>` or `gh issue <sub>` command with at least one
#   argument after <sub> must pass -R or --repo a <host>/<owner>/<repo> value, attached
#   or separated, or an argument that starts with https:// or http:// or is <url>; a
#   `gh api` command with at least one argument must pass the option --hostname with
#   a value, as `--hostname <host>` or `--hostname=<host>`; the text inside another
#   argument, such as `q=--hostname`, does not count. A command may
#   start anywhere in the span (after a blank, `;`, `|`, `&`, or `(`) and ends at the
#   next `;`, `|`, `&`, or `)`. A single-quoted argument with no blank, `;`, `|`, `&`,
#   or `)` in it counts without its quotes; other single-quoted text is ignored. Without
#   a host, gh uses its default host, which can differ from the bundle's. A span with no
#   argument, such as "`gh api` calls" or "`gh issue view` has no parent field", is
#   prose and does not count, nor does an argument that starts with `*`, as in an
#   allowed-tools pattern. Not checked: a span that runs across lines, and lines inside
#   ``` fenced code blocks. A self-test runs the check on fixed sample lines first and
#   fails when its result differs from the expected one; an awk failure also fails.
# - The converged item shape, the ``` fenced block whose first line is
#   `## C<n>: <title>`, appears in agents/merger.md and in
#   skills/cca/stages/7-converge.md, and the two blocks are the same after leading
#   blanks and CRs are removed. The merger reads only its own file and its prompt, so
#   the shape the stage 7 check needs must be in merger.md.
#
# Exit 0 when every check passes. Otherwise print one line per failure and exit 1.
