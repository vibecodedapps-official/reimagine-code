## Outward trace challenged
- app-OT1: upheld; evidence: app@abc:src/a.sh:4 discards the status
- app-OT2: broken, finding app-P1; evidence: app@abc:src/b.sh:9 lacks the check
Example of a gap line:
```text
### app-P9: example
## Coverage gaps
- outward trace: app:src/x.sh:y not traced
```

### app-P1: Sibling lacks the check
- severity: medium
- question: Q1
- label: verified fact
- origin: pass2
- evidence: app@abc:src/b.sh:9
- demonstrated: the same input reaches it

## Coverage gaps
- outward trace: app:src/b.sh:helper not traced
- outward trace: app:src/d.sh:extra (src/d.sh:3) not traced
runs: none
consumed: none

## app-F1
- origin: pass1
- author: cca:auditor, model m-a, file pass1/app.md
### Original
### app-F1: Run drops the failure branch
- severity: high
- question: Q1
- label: verified fact
- evidence: app@abc:src/a.sh:4 `run || true`
- demonstrated: the failure status is discarded
### Pass-two verdicts
- downgraded by cca:adversary (model m-b) in pass2/app.md: a later line checks the status; evidence: app@abc:src/a.sh:6 tests the status
### State after pass two
medium, verified fact, downgraded

## app-F2
- origin: pass1
- author: cca:auditor, model m-a, file pass1/app.md
### Original
### app-F2: Helper has no caller
- severity: low
- question: Q2
- label: convention
- evidence: search git grep helper, no result
- demonstrated: nothing reads it
### Pass-two verdicts
- survives by cca:adversary (model m-b) in pass2/app.md: stands; evidence: git grep helper finds no caller
### State after pass two
low, convention, survives

## app-P1
- origin: pass2
- author: cca:adversary, model m-b, file pass2/app.md
### Original
### app-P1: Sibling lacks the check
- severity: medium
- question: Q1
- label: verified fact
- origin: pass2
- evidence: app@abc:src/b.sh:9
- demonstrated: the same input reaches it
### Pass-two verdicts
- none
### State after pass two
medium, verified fact, no verdict: late addition

## Verified OK challenged: app
- app-OK1: held

## Coverage gaps: app
