# working-tree.sh: test skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh against the solo fixture.
#
# Usage: sh tests/cca/working-tree.sh
#
# The solo fixture is built once (tests/fixture/build.sh); each case works on a fresh copy
# of its app repo, or on a repo built inline with a pinned identity and commit date, so
# every sha in an expected line is a literal and is the same on every machine. Git runs
# with no global or system config. Each run of the script gets an empty TMPDIR, which must
# be empty again afterwards, so the script's temporary index is always removed. An object
# count is the `count:` of `git count-objects -v`, so a temporary file git leaves under
# .git/objects is not one (case 21). The script under test runs under `sh`, or under
# $WT_SH when set, for example `WT_SH=dash sh tests/working-tree.sh`.
#
# The literal shas: the solo app's feature head, 0c23936980b254c4abd489d3ecfd296f5e7bc0db,
# is the parent of every build. The synthetic head and tree are the script's output for
# the fixture with its one untracked file (notes/deactivate-draft.txt), written down once.
# Every file the fixture writes is a regular file without the executable bit, and git runs
# with core.autocrlf unset, so a literal does not depend on the operating system. The
# other literals (cases 3, 6o, 7, 10, 18) were written down the same way, once, from a
# run: every input is pinned (the fixture, the identity and dates of `g`, and the script's
# own identity and date), so they are the same on every machine too. A flagged path is
# held at its index version, so a build with flagged paths gives the head and tree of the
# same repo without the flags and edits (6c, 6d, 6m, 18).
#
# Cases:
#  1 build on the solo app             2 a second build
#  3 a tracked file edited             4 commit.gpgSign=true in local config
#  5 GIT_INDEX_FILE set by the caller  4b core.fsmonitor hook not run
#  6 refusals (6a, 6b, 6e to 6l; 6n flagged paths the build cannot hold, and 6q sparse
#    checkout in a submodule, in `check` and `build`), each with the object count;
#    flagged paths built and listed (6c skip-worktree unedited, edited, deleted; 6d
#    assume-unchanged edited; 6m a deleted one, and two paths; 6o a file staged then
#    flagged holds the staged blob; 6p a copy of the script without refusal 3 reaches the
#    safety net and exits 2)
#  7 a submodule whose HEAD moved      8 a failed git step (8a, 8b)
#  9 not a work tree, and usage errors
# 10 a staged file that matches an ignore rule   11 no index file
# 12 `check`: no output and no write, and the same refusal lines as `build`
# 13 a submodule's own program filter, refused with the submodule prefix
# 14 a repo hook is not run         15 a renamed submodule with a change is refused
# 16 a driver named `set`            17 no index file, an ignored tracked file with a filter
# 18 flagged files in the top level and a submodule, built and listed in scan order
# 19 a quoted submodule path with a program filter (19a top level, 19b in a submodule)
# 20 core.autocrlf=true: no line-ending warning on stderr
# 21 the object count is git's: a stray maintenance.lock or tmp_obj file is not an object
#
# Prints one line per mismatch, then `working-tree test: ok` when there were none. Exit 0
# when every case matches, otherwise 1.
