# revert-tests.sh: test skills/cca/scripts/revert-tests.sh on repos built inline and on the
# patterns and ground-truth fixtures.
#
# Usage: sh tests/cca/revert-tests.sh
#
# Each inline repo is built with plumbing (hash-object, update-index, write-tree,
# commit-tree), with a pinned identity and date, so a symlink, a submodule, and a path with
# a newline need no support from the file system. Git runs with no global or system
# config. The script under test is started with `sh`, or with $RT_SH when set, for example
# `RT_SH=dash sh tests/revert-tests.sh`, and re-executes itself under bash; the test files
# it runs use `sh` either way. Every
# verdict is compared as a literal line of the result file. A test file that starts a
# process writes its pid under $RT_PIDS, and that process must be gone when the script
# returns. The work dir must be gone too, and no `.tmp` result file may be left.
#
# Cases:
#  1 statuses: A, M, D, a rename with each side in and out of test_paths, T (a file to a
#    symlink), a helper under tests/ outside test_run, a path with a space and a quote, a
#    test-code path with a newline, and a submodule and an LFS pointer in both trees; 1b
#    the same where `head` is not GNU coreutils, so each blob is written on its own
#  2 no changed tests to run            3 a missing tool: exit 127 counts as a run
#  4 setup fails in the head copy (4a), and in the reverted copy only (4b)
#  5 processes: a background process left by a passing file and a child that ignores TERM
#    after its parent dies at the deadline (5a); a command that ignores TERM until KILL
#    (5b); 5a with no controlling terminal, under dash where installed (5c, needs setsid)
#  6 the time cap                        7 the file cap, with 21 files
#  8 a path conflict                     9 the environment: LC_ALL, GIT_*, TMPDIR, and
#    GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
# 10 an interrupt mid-run: exit 2, no process, no work dir, no result file
# 11 argument and keys errors: exit 2 with one line; an existing work dir is left alone
# 12 the patterns fixture               13 the ground-truth fixture
# 14 an empty merge-base tree
# 15 bg and wait: a run in the background (15a), a keys error with a stale .exit (15b), the
#    deadline (15c), wait's window (15d), no run (15e), TERM to bg (15f), wrong arguments
#    (15g), the deadline during a blocked git step (15h), KILL to bg (15i)
# 16 a partial clone is refused without fetching   17 a tab path is not used
# 18 forkdone, from the script's own text: bash's `child setpgid` line is dropped and any
#    other fork-time line kept (18a); a job started outside its own group fails the start
#    with exit 2 (18b)
#
# Prints one line per mismatch, then `revert-tests test: ok` when there were none. Exit 0
# when every case matches, otherwise 1.
