# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- A headless run (`claude -p`) no longer ends in stage 1 at the reverted test step. The
  step ran `revert-tests.sh run` and, past the Bash tool's limit, waited for a
  completion notification. A foreground command is killed at its timeout rather than
  moved to the background, and a headless session ends when its turn ends with only a
  background command running. Stage 1 now starts `revert-tests.sh bg` in the background
  and repeats `revert-tests.sh wait`, which returns within 9 minutes, until the run is
  done. The 30-minute cap per bundle is unchanged. A run stops when the session that
  started it ends, so a resumed stage 1 cannot collide with it (#37).

## 0.8.0 - 2026-10-05

Adds three auditor checks for cases both earlier `ground-truth` runs missed: each
decision a consumer makes on a widened input, a test that runs as a stronger account
than it needs, and a renamed run-once script that repeats work. The recorded run found
18 of the 20 cases, against 15, at about 9% more agent tokens. No manifest key changes.
A run started under 0.7.0 or earlier reruns from stage 1 on resume.

### Added

- The outward trace lists each decision that reads an input a change widens (a rule, a
  branch, or a key lookup in a consumer), and marks which ones the ticket, the PR, the
  claims, or a test covers. A decision whose outcome changed with no coverage is a
  finding. Before, a consumer was judged as one reader, so a rule that began to follow a
  setting the ticket never mentions went unreported (#32).
- The tests checklist flags an added or changed test, step, or scenario that runs as an
  account, role, or credential with write or admin rights when it only reads. The finding
  names the account, where its rights come from, and the narrower role the test needs.
  When no grant is found and the rights are only pointed to, by code that writes with the
  account or by its name, it is an unverified finding with a live check on the grants
  (#33).

### Changed

- Group and `combined` auditors now check a renamed or copied run-once script (`R` or
  `C` in the run-once list) for repeated work. A runner that journals by name runs the
  new name on every install that ran the old one, so a step whose result an install that
  ran the old name already has, and that nothing guards, runs again there, even when the
  end state is the same. The finding is an `unverified assumption`, at most medium, with a
  live check on the old script's journal entry. The run-once list now carries each old
  path and score. No new manifest key (part of #23).

## 0.7.0 - 2026-10-04

Adds an opt-in stage 1 step that runs a bundle's changed tests with the change reverted,
so a test that passes without its change is shown by a run, not only flagged by reading.
Nothing new runs unless a bundle sets `test_command`. A run started under 0.6.0 or
earlier reruns from stage 1 on resume.

### Added

- The `ground-truth` fixture: 20 confirmed findings from a hand review, de-identified
  in `tests/fixture/ground-truth-cases.md`, planted in one repo across two bundles, with
  decoys and checks that show each defect is real (#21). Detection is recorded per audit
  run in `docs/acceptance.md`: 16 of the 20 cases under 0.6.0, and 15 with the test
  keys, at about 3% more cost. One run each is one sample.
- Optional `test_command` and `test_run` bundle keys, with `test_paths`, `test_setup`,
  and `test_timeout`. Stage 1 then runs each changed test file in a copy of the head and
  in a copy of the merge-base with the test code at its head state, and writes one
  verdict per file to `revert/<bundle>.md`. Auditors read it as a run: a file, or a
  test named in its output, that passes without the change can support a
  `verified fact` finding (#22). The commands run with your environment and
  credentials, in copies under cca's data directory, and only when you set the keys.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-10-03

Widens what an auditor checks: weak tests, producers changed on the base, edits to
run-once scripts, and an outward trace from each change. The same bundle can get a
different verdict, and a medium run cost about 11% more in agent tokens on the
`patterns` fixture. A run started under 0.5.2 or earlier reruns from stage 1 on resume.

### Added

- The tests checklist flags an added or changed test that asserts the code's own
  constant, pins text without running the code, or accepts a wrong outcome. A flag
  becomes a finding only when the auditor names the regression the test would miss
  (#18).
- Group and `combined` auditors read the producer of each literal or shape a change
  matches on at the head and at the base sha. They report a producer that the base
  changed and the head does not match (#19).
- An optional `run_once` bundle key of glob patterns. Stage 1 lists the changed files
  that match, with whether each exists at the merge-base. An auditor reports an edit to
  an existing run-once script as an unverified finding with a live check on the
  environment's journal (part of #20).
- Group and `combined` auditors write `## Outward trace`: for each changed symbol, up to
  15 per scope, its siblings, new callees, and consumers, one hop out, each `sound`, a
  finding, or `incomplete`. The pass-two adversary checks it is complete at every tier
  and challenges entries as it does Verified OK. Omissions go to Coverage gaps and the
  report's Coverage. The second opinion traces too before it picks new findings (#17).
- The `patterns` fixture, with one planted case each for #17 to #20 and checks that show
  each defect is real.
- `docs/acceptance.md` records three full multi-agent audit runs on it: before the
  rules of #18 to #20, after them, and with the outward trace. All three found every
  planted case in pass one. With the rules, the run-once finding carries a live check,
  and its label follows the live check rule.

### Fixed

- `agents/merger.md` now gives the converged item shape: the `## C<n>: ` heading and
  every line, including `- tickets:` and `- recommended change:`. The shape was only in
  the orchestrator's stage 7 file, which the merger never reads, so the merger guessed
  it. On one run it wrote `### C<n>:` headings, failed the stage 7 check, and the
  orchestrator redid the merge (#27). `tests/lint.sh` keeps the two copies the same.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-10-03

Fixes from a review of 0.5.1. A run started under 0.5.1 or earlier reruns from stage 1
on resume.

### Added

- `ledger.sh late-check <run dir> --tier <tier> --stage6 complete|failed` checks
  `late/adversary.md` as soon as the late adversary returns: the final
  `status: complete`, the parse rules, a verdict for every id `late-ids` lists and none
  for an id it does not, and no `L` addition that reuses a carried id. A problem now
  takes the late adversary's retry ladder in stage 7 step 2. Before, a missing late
  verdict surfaced only in the check after the merge, as a merger failure the merger
  could not fix.

### Fixed

- `check --through 7 --late complete` accepted a late adversary file without a final
  `status: complete`.
- A stage 6 position reading `Restore requested` (any letter case) now puts the id on the
  late adversary's list. A position whose first word is `restore` but which does not
  start with `restore requested` is a `check --through 6` problem, so a reworded request
  is no longer dropped without notice.
- With stage 6 failed, a partial `ledger/6.md` that ends inside a fence or holds a
  malformed addition heading no longer makes `late-ids` and `gate` exit 1. The bad block
  is left out, and `check` still reports it. With stage 6 complete these stay errors.
- A pass file subheading such as `### x86: notes` is no longer a malformed finding
  heading. Lower-case `x<n>` and `l<n>` count as mis-cased ids only in the files that
  carry additions.
- The shell examples in stage 6 step 4.3 and stage 7 step 7.2 name every path under
  `<run dir>/`. As written they ran against the audited repo's working directory.
- When an input went unacknowledged, the stage 6 follow-up passes the text of
  `codex/followup.md` in the call itself. A Codex that could not open the run directory
  could not open the follow-up file either, so the recovery could never succeed.
- The follow-up leaves asks 1 and 2 out when no id needs asking, and the placeholder
  replacement fails the stage when no line held the placeholder or the id list is empty,
  instead of sending `for these ids:` with nothing after it.
- `merger.md`, stage 7 step 4, and the README no longer restate a gate rule that
  contradicted the script for a second-opinion addition, which counts on a late verdict
  alone. The merger takes each gate from `gate.md`.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-10-03

Hardens the ledger checks of 0.5.0: ids and follow-up asks no longer pass through the
model's hands, and `ledger.sh` reads outputs more strictly. No full multi-agent audit has
run yet.

### Added

- `ledger.sh late-ids <run dir> --tier <tier> --stage6 complete|failed`: the late
  adversary's id list (every pass-two and top-up addition, every `X` addition, every
  restore request at medium and high, and every live id at every tier) is built by the
  script into `tmp/late-ids.txt`, and the prompt passes the file path. `check --through 7`
  reports any id of that list without a verdict in
  `ledger/7.md`.

### Changed

- The stage 6 follow-up is a file, `codex/followup.md`, that `codex-lite:ask` is told to
  read by path, so no id is typed into a tool argument. The byte cap applies to the file.
- Stage 6 builds batch files with a portable awk, and the request carries a placeholder
  line per slot (`for these ids: IDS-BATCH-<k>`) that shell replaces in place, not an
  append at the end of the file. The follow-up slots use the same mechanism.
- A finding block now ends at `runs:`, `runs: none`, `consumed:`, `consumed: none`,
  `opened:`, `opened: none`, or `status: complete` when the line is exactly that; a body
  line that merely starts with one of those words no longer cuts a finding.
- A pass or top-up file counts as complete only when it ends with `status: complete`,
  checked from the file against the inventory.
- A heading with a mis-cased id is an error, and a position line may start with a list
  number.
- Both map-correction headings are required in `ledger/5.md`.
- The review gate text in stage 7 and `merger.md` states the current rule: a reviewer
  other than the author challenged it, and the second opinion gave a position on it when
  it is medium or above, or acknowledged it when low or note.
- `pass2/<scope>.md` replaces `pass2/<group>.md` in `codex-request.md` and stage 5, and
  stage 6 lists `ledger/mandatory.txt`, `codex/batch-<k>.txt`, and `codex/followup.md`
  among its outputs.
- A run started under 0.5.0 or earlier reruns from stage 1 on resume.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-10-03

Adds `ledger.sh` and its checks, a medium-severity rule for the second opinion, one path
for live checks, and `invocations.md`. No full multi-agent audit has run yet; the
agent-driven cases in `docs/acceptance.md` are still `not run`.

### Added

- `skills/cca/scripts/ledger.sh`, with `tests/ledger.sh`. It builds the finding sections
  of `ledger/5.md`, the mandatory id list, the list of ids seen without a position, and
  `gate.md`. Its checks: the finding part of `ledger/5.md` equals what the script builds
  from the pass files (the inventory is reconciled against `pass1/` and `pass2/`); at
  stage 6, every mandatory id has a position with provenance in a Codex response file,
  and every other `ledger/5.md` id has a position or is on the seen list; Codex and late
  additions match the raw answers; `gate.md` equals the computed gate; and every id is
  absorbed by exactly one converged item whose gate matches. Evidence, the condensation
  of positions, dedupe, and the severity and contested checks stay model-judged. Stages 5
  to 8 run it, and stage 5 writes `ledger/inventory.txt` for it. The parsing rules are in
  `common.md`.
- `invocations.md` in the run directory: each invocation block, appended verbatim and
  never rewritten, re-read after a compaction. `/cca:resume` and `/cca:act` read their
  `--from`, `--live`, items, and `--per-item` values from the last block. A run from
  0.4.0 or earlier has none.
- `skills/cca/fault-injection.md`, the `_test` rules moved out of `SKILL.md`, read only
  when the manifest has a `_test` key.
- The README says that ignored-file write attribution is self-reported and repo-level,
  that a `.git` created inside a tracked directory is not detected, and that Codex's
  read of a file outside every repo was verified on Windows with the elevated sandbox
  only. It recommends an ignored in-repo scratch directory or the manifest `scratch` key.

### Changed

- A run started under 0.4.0 or earlier and resumed under 0.5.0 reruns from stage 1.
- A stage 6 position is mandatory for every finding at medium severity or above, not
  only blocker and high. A low or note finding may still count on the second opinion's
  acknowledgment, and the gate reason says which. A medium finding no longer counts with
  no position. The README says what "seen" means.
- Live access has one path. The orchestrator never asks for it during a run, a needed
  check becomes a report item, and approvals come only from a `--live` file. The agent
  boundary clause that allowed a check "when your prompt says the user approved" it is
  removed from the auditor, digester, mapper, and adversary.
- The queue launches digests, then maps, then pass one, so more digests and maps finish
  before the barrier. Top-ups stay, since the order cannot remove misses.
- `readonly.sh` compares with awk and hashes in batches, with the same output.
- A merged item's severity, label, and disposition come only from absorbed ids that
  count.
- The README opens with what cca mainly is: an evidence-reading audit, strongest on
  drift between claims, tickets, and code, that runs local tests and lint where
  supported, and sees runtime behavior only through live results you supply.
- Stage 6 launches the fallback batches for ids that neither the Codex request nor its
  follow-up carries before the follow-up call, then waits without any other call.
- `ledger/5.md` and `gate.md` are built in `tmp/` and moved into place only when the
  script succeeds, so a failed build leaves no file for stage 8 to trust. Stage 8's
  ledger fallback never reuses `gate.md` and gives late verdicts no credit, since stage
  7's checks did not pass; P, T, and X findings are provisional in that report.
- Stage 6 never reads the mandatory id list: it goes to `ledger/mandatory.txt`, is
  counted with `wc -l`, split into `codex/batch-<k>.txt` files by shell, and written into
  each request's `for these ids:` slot by shell. The follow-up's missing ids come from
  `ledger.sh missing`, which reads the saved answer by the same rules as `check`. A
  `--- follow-up, thread <id> ---` or `--- batch <k> ---` line closes any code fence the
  text before it left open, so the follow-up's positions are read. Only Codex's answer is
  saved before that check; a fallback batch keeps its own response file. Every `ledger.sh check` writes to a file and is read as a line count plus
  its first 50 lines, in stages 5 to 7.
- A finding in a failed pass or top-up file is kept in `ledger/5.md` with the state `no
  verdict: output failed`. The failed review gives it no credit: a pass-one finding stays
  provisional, and a pass-two or top-up addition counts only through the late adversary
  and a second-opinion position, like any late addition. A block that cannot be parsed
  is counted on that file's `## Failed outputs` line.
- `check --through 7` rejects a `C<n>` heading that appears twice in `converged.md`.
- `/cca:resume` reruns from stage 5 when a complete stage 5 entry has no
  `ledger/inventory.txt` in its outputs (a run from 0.4.0 or earlier), since `ledger.sh`
  needs it.
- `report.md` points to `stages/8-report.md`, steps 4 and 5, for the verdict rules.
- `working-tree.sh`'s header says `check` covers the refusals only, not failures of
  `build`'s git steps.

### Fixed

- `readonly.sh` reports `touched b.txt` when `a b.txt` is edited and `b.txt` is touched:
  it matches the exact path, not a suffix of the line.
- `readonly.sh` reads a relative baseline or out prefix such as `k=v/b` as a file, not
  an awk assignment, and hashes a path starting with `"` on its own, outside the batch.
- `work-items.sh` writes its missing-`jq` message to stderr.
- `live.md` ends a block at one or more `#` and a space, as `live.sh` does.
- `common.md` writes every finding id as `<scope>-F<n>`, `<scope>-P<n>`, or
  `<scope>-T<n>`.
- The README's development section lists all seven scripts, every test, the `tokens`
  fixture, and what CI runs (the mawk step runs handoff, readonly, live, memory,
  working-tree, and ledger), and its low-tier late adversary cell matches the stages.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-10-02

Adds `result_file` to `--live` results and builds working-tree bundles that have
skip-worktree or assume-unchanged paths. No full multi-agent audit has run yet; the
agent-driven cases in `docs/acceptance.md` are still `not run`.

### Added

- A `--live` entry can give `result_file: <path>` in place of a one-line `result`, so a
  result that is more than one line, such as the rows a query returns, is kept verbatim.
  The path is relative to the `--live` file and stays under its directory. `live.sh
  import` copies each file to `live/results-<k>/<heading line>.txt` and writes
  `SHA256SUMS` from the copies, committed with the results file. `import`, `active`, and
  `assemble` stop with a named line when a copy of an active import is missing or no
  longer matches its hash. The derivation, the second opinion, the late adversary, and
  the report read the copy, and the report gives its path and hash.

### Fixed

- `skills/cca/work-items.md` says what `work-items.sh` already enforces: a required
  top-level string field, `comment_id` included, must not be empty (`set_field`'s
  `value` may be).
- "Writing a handoff" in `skills/cca/handoff.md` says `parent` and `links` come only from
  the forge record, never from PR or commit text, as `/cca:handoff` already did.

### Changed

- A `head: working-tree` bundle whose repo has skip-worktree or assume-unchanged paths is
  built, not refused. The head holds each flagged path at its index version, whatever
  its file on disk holds, and `working-tree.sh build` prints one `flagged <path>` line
  per such path, submodules included. The brief and the report's Coverage list them, and
  the bundle is read from an export of its head, never from the local files. A flagged
  path the build cannot hold at its index version is still refused: a flagged submodule
  or intent-to-add entry, a path that is a directory on disk or lies under a symlink or
  a file, or a path git prints quoted, which cannot be checked on disk. The read-only
  check does not compare a flagged file's content, so a change to one during the run may
  escape it; Coverage says so. Resume reruns stage 1 when a directly read working-tree
  bundle now has a flagged path, in a submodule too. A sparse checkout is now refused in
  a checked-out submodule too, not only in the top level.
- `working-tree.sh build` no longer prints git's line-ending warnings on stderr under the
  default `core.safecrlf`; a repo that sets `core.safecrlf=true` keeps it. Stage 1 treats
  a stderr line with exit 0 as a warning, not a refusal. The README says that one flagged
  path makes the bundle an export, where no test runs, and how to clear a flag first.
- A run started under 0.3.1 and resumed under 0.4.0 reruns from stage 1.

## 0.3.1 - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Stage 1's GitHub reads name the host of the PR or ticket they read, `github.com`
  included, so they no longer go to gh's default host (`GH_HOST`, else the only saved
  login) when that differs from the bundle's host (#13). The host comes from the id's URL,
  else from the bundle repo's remote for that owner and repo, else, for a ticket, from
  the bundle's PR, else `github.com`. An SSH remote on a host other than GitHub's counts
  only when gh knows that host, which needs gh 2.81.0 or later unless the id is given
  as a URL; a known host whose login fails is never swapped for another. Resume and
  `/cca:handoff` name the same host, and resume reruns stage 1 when a host changed.
  When the PR read, its review threads, or a named ticket's read fails, the run stops
  with a line that names the host it queried; give the id as a URL when that host is
  wrong. A failed read of a closing issue, or of a ticket's parent, is a gap listed in
  the brief, not a stop, and resume retries it. `tests/lint.sh` fails on a
  `gh pr` or `gh issue` command in a code span under `agents/`, `skills/`, or
  `commands/` that passes neither `-R <host>/<owner>/<repo>` nor a URL argument, and on
  a `gh api` command without a `--hostname` option.

### Changed

- A run started under 0.3.0 and resumed under 0.3.1 reruns from stage 1.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-01

Closes issues #5 to #11. No full multi-agent audit has run yet; see `docs/acceptance.md`.

### Added

- A manifest bundle key `head: working-tree` audits uncommitted work. Stage 1 builds a
  commit from the working tree with `skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh`, without touching
  the index or refs, and reads the checkout directly, so tests can run. The objects it
  writes, and that the head has no ref, are disclosed in the report. A repo whose files use
  Git LFS or a filter that runs a program, or whose nested repositories have uncommitted
  work, is refused.
- `/cca:resume <run> --live <file>` feeds approved live check results back into a run. The
  format is in `skills/cca/live.md`, validated by `skills/cca/scripts/live.sh`. A changed
  finding goes back to the second opinion and the late adversary before it counts.
- Verification checks tagged `env: <name>;` are listed as live checks by claim number, and
  `claims-verdicts.md` calls them `not reproducible here`, not recheck requests.
- Optional handoff keys `parent` and `links`, for tickets and raised tickets. Stage 1 fetches
  the PRs that close a GitHub ticket, and its parent through GraphQL, so hygiene can check
  both.
- Work-item operations `update_comment`, `remove_link`, and `set_fields`, mentions, and
  `W<n>` items for supporting operations.
- A manifest bundle key `ticket_token`, so a bare-number ticket id matches only as a ticket
  reference, and a `tokens` fixture.
- `/cca:handoff --memory <dir>` lists the memory files that hold each `false` claim's keys,
  with `skills/cca/scripts/memory.sh`. `claims-verdicts.md` gains a `ticket:` sub-line.

### Changed

- `work-items.sh` rejects unknown keys, an empty `set_fields`, a `W<n>` that names no
  operation, and operations that reach no report item or claim.
- Report section 9 lists each live check as a block keyed by finding id or claim number.
- GitHub tickets need gh 2.73.0 or later.
- `/cca:resume --live` needs `jq`, on any forge.
- CI runs the three new script tests on all runners and under mawk, and fails when jq is
  missing.
- A run started under 0.2.0 and resumed under 0.3.0 reruns from stage 1.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-01

Closes the gaps found by one real audit of 0.1.0, and adds a typed handoff from the build
session to the audit, with a return trip back. No full multi-agent audit has run yet; see
`docs/acceptance.md`.

### Added

- `/cca:handoff`: run in the build session, it writes a typed `handoff.md` (tickets,
  decisions, raised tickets) from the record, and with `--verdicts` applies a
  `claims-verdicts.md` from an earlier audit.
- The handoff format (`skills/cca/handoff.md`) and `skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh`, which
  detects, validates, and turns a handoff into typed claims and a commit list. A leading
  UTF-8 byte order mark is ignored, and a claim line over 8,000 bytes, ids included, is
  an error, since a claim is read as one line. A section with no item and no `none` is an
  error.
- Typed claims, with kinds `code`, `decision`, `verification`, `scope`, and `status`.
  Prose claims files get a kind per sentence. A handoff's commit lists seed the review
  groups.
- A decision ledger for `decision` claims: each is `stale deferral`, `needs <owner>`,
  `default taken`, or `evidenced`, with a reversibility class. Report section 8 lists them.
  A missing ledger or scope entry is `not assessed`, and a missing challenge line `not
  challenged`; neither fails a scope or changes the verdict counts.
- A scope check for raised tickets: introduced by the bundle or not, fix inside the
  bundle's repos or not, cost, include or defer, and any disagreement with the handoff.
- `claims-verdicts.md`, a stage 8 output that tells the build session which of its
  statements were shown false, which could not be reproduced, and which are contested.
- `work-items.jsonl` and `skills/cca/scripts/work-items.sh`: a work-item operations plan,
  one JSON object per operation, with placeholders for tickets that do not exist yet, and
  its validator. Nothing applies it; no forge adapter ships.
- A manifest `scratch` key: an ignored path in the primary repo, under any name, for the
  run directory.
- `skills/cca/scripts/readonly.sh`: the per-stage read-only check as a script.
- Tests `tests/readonly.sh`, `tests/handoff.sh`, and `tests/work-items.sh`, and a CI
  `scripts` job on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The fixture gains a handoff and two
  manifests.
- README: a "Before the first run" note on sizing sources, and the new commands and
  outputs.

### Changed

- A `verification` claim is `true` only when the audit reproduces the result itself. One
  it cannot reproduce is `not verified` with the reason `not reproduced`, listed in
  `claims-verdicts.md` as a recheck request, never as a correction. The pass-two
  adversary re-checks every verification claim marked `true`. A run under a different
  setup than the stated check needs is not counter-evidence, and the handoff asks the
  writer to name a check's preconditions.
- The read-only check runs a script. An ignored file is compared by size and sub-second
  modification time, and each audited repo has its own baseline marker. Paths that git
  prints quoted are not supported and stop the check with exit 2. Nested repositories
  (checked-out submodules and untracked repositories inside an audited repo) are checked
  as part of it, and the files under a submodule that is not checked out are hashed. An
  upstream's ahead and behind count is no longer compared, and the run directory is
  matched without regard to case where the repo's `core.ignorecase` is true. The check
  compares its output prefix with the baseline and the run directory by file identity, and
  refuses a prefix with a `..` component, so a prefix spelled in other letters or routed
  through a missing directory cannot overwrite the baseline. A repository inside an
  ignored directory is recorded as one ignored directory, so a change inside it is not
  detected unless it adds or removes an entry at its top level, and the report says so.
- The stage 1 ticket token rule now names the token for an exported ticket (its `id`),
  matches a GitHub `#n` only for an issue in the bundle's repo, and checks a boundary on
  both sides, so `APP-1` matches neither `APP-1a` nor `XAPP-1`. Before a GitHub token the
  character is also not `-`, `_`, `.`, or `/`, so `owner/app#12` does not match inside
  `other-owner/app#12`.
- No git command cca or its agents issue rewrites an audited repo's index: the check
  script sets `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, the stages run `git status` with
  `--no-optional-locks`, and agents diff only between two commits, since a working-tree
  `git diff` writes the index even with that flag.
- Agents run no test or lint command in an exported tree, in `skills/cca/common.md`,
  stage 1, and the agent definitions.
- Codex requests: the request names every input by absolute path, whatever the run
  directory, and Codex acknowledges each input with its sentinel. Only an input it could not
  open goes inline, in the one follow-up, under the 450,000-byte cap, over which stage 6
  fails. The inline first request, its diff dropping, and `inline_reduced` are gone. A probe
  showed Codex reads a file outside every repository by absolute path in codex-lite's
  read-only sandbox on Windows; Linux and macOS rely on Codex's documented policy.
- Stage 8 writes three outputs: `report.md`, `claims-verdicts.md`, and `work-items.jsonl`.
- The README no longer says "Tested on"; it says what ran and what has not.

A run started under 0.1.0 and resumed under 0.2.0 reruns from stage 1, by the existing
input-hash rule.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-30

First release. Built against Claude Code 2.1.284; see `docs/acceptance.md` for what ran.

### Added

- `/cca:audit`: a read-only, adversarial audit of a bundle of pull requests in one or
  many repos, from a manifest, prompt inputs, or both. Stages: orient, digest, domain
  map, pass one, pass two, second opinion, converge, and report.
- `/cca:resume`: reruns a run from the first stage that is incomplete or whose inputs
  changed, or from `--from <stage>`, reusing earlier stages.
- `/cca:act`: makes local commits for report items you approve by id, with baseline and
  per-commit checks, a confirmation per commit, and no push or forge edits unless you
  say so per item.
- Five role agents, `cca:digester`, `cca:mapper`, `cca:auditor`, `cca:adversary`, and
  `cca:merger`, none with Edit or NotebookEdit.
- Effort tiers low, medium, and high, picked from the bundle's size or set with
  `--effort`.
- A review gate: a finding counts toward the verdict only after a reviewer other than
  its author challenged it and both a Claude adversary and the second opinion saw it.
- The read-only boundary with a stage-end check that stops the run `blocked` on a
  change to an audited repo, and exact tree exports from git objects when a checkout is
  not at the audited sha.
- Codex second opinion through codex-lite, optional, with a named swap to a fresh
  adversary agent.
- Exported forge files for tickets and PRs from forges cca does not query.
- `--budget`, `--max-agents`, and `usage.md` with labeled token numbers.
- Development checks: `tests/lint.sh` and the `tests/fixture/build.sh` fixture builder.

### Fixed before release

Review fixes applied between the first candidate and the tag, on 2026-09-30 and
2026-10-01.

- Stage 6: the acknowledgment check applies to the fallback's answer too, not only
  Codex's.
- Stage 6: every blocker or high finding and every pass-two downgrade or drop needs a
  position; missing ones get one follow-up, then fail the stage (`missing_positions`);
  above 60 mandatory ids the asks are batched (`batched`): Codex gets the first batch
  and at most 60 positions in its one follow-up, every other id goes to the fallback
  (one launch per batch of 60, a partial swap), and the fallback is launched once per
  batch without Codex. The
  stage fails on such a batch only when it fails after the ladder. Every mandatory id
  is requested in a run that completes.
- Stage 6: a request over the inline cap is first reduced by dropping the diffs of
  session-repository bundles (`inline_reduced`) before the swap; other repos' diffs
  are never dropped.
- Stage 8: the terminal state is decided from stages 1 to 7 only.
- Stage 1: fetches are explicit, tag-free, into remote-tracking refs only, verified by
  sha, and recorded in the approval, which covers only its listed commands; a
  `<other remote>/<branch>` ref is fetched from that remote.
- Stage 1: a GitHub PR bundle's base is pinned to the local sha of
  `<remote>/<baseRefName>` after the approved fetch (`baseRefOid` is recorded for
  information only), refreshed with every approved fetch; every restricted fetch passes
  `--refmap=`; resume stops and asks for a changed head or base sha.
- Resume: hash pipelines fail closed (`pipefail`), and a GitHub-backed run without
  `forge_hashes` reruns stage 1. Stage 6: the Codex follow-up asks for at most 60
  positions; the rest go to the fallback.
- Stage 1: `gh` output is saved by shell redirect, and a `jq` projection of it
  (`pr.hash.json`) is hashed (`forge_hashes`); resume re-queries once and compares.
  `jq` is required for GitHub PRs.
- Stage 1: the run directory is created before the PR is read.
- Stage 1: each repo has one selected remote (for a GitHub PR bundle, the one whose
  URL names the PR's repo, settled at section C; for other repos, selected lazily when
  a fetch is needed; a PR bundle whose repo has no remote stops), and the fetch also
  covers tags and shas. A fetch approval for a bare name covers the `ls-remote` check
  and either candidate refspec and records the resolved kind. The run id slug for a
  `file:` PR export uses the export's `id`, else the bundle's `branch`.
- Resume: reads `manifest.json` and `stages.json` first and reruns from stage 1 when
  stage 1 is missing, running, or has no brief, or when `stages.json` is missing; it
  never moves `manifest.json`, includes `tmp/` in the walk, and removes stale
  `pr.json.new` files on the stage-1-rerun path.
- Stage 2: a text file over 450,000 bytes is split into byte-range chunks
  (`split_files`), measured in place for an exported tree or from a copy under the
  run's `tmp/` for a directly read one, and read by the digester in slices of up to
  24,000 bytes ending at a line break, with absolute line numbers from one `awk` stage.
- Stage 7: split-mode group mergers read per-group slices under `ledger/slices/`,
  written by shell (`awk`, `printf`, redirects), not through the model.
- Docs: acceptance evidence for the fixture map path and the lint output for an agent
  that lists Edit.
