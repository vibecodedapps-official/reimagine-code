# cca

A Claude Code plugin that takes a finished bundle of work (one or many pull requests, in
one or many repos) and tries to break it before merge. Every stage is adversarial and
evidence-gated. The audit is read-only and stops at a report. The only write phase is a
separate command that acts on items you approve by id.

Each pull request in a large bundle can look fine alone while the bundle drifts from its
tickets, breaks rules in a guidelines corpus nobody reread, and carries claims in the
build session's summary that were never true. cca checks the bundle as a whole: every
finding cites evidence, is challenged by a fresh Claude adversary other than its author,
and, at medium severity or above, needs a position from a second opinion before it counts
toward the verdict.

cca is mainly an evidence-reading audit, and it is strongest on drift between the claims,
the tickets, and the code. It runs the repo's local tests and lint where it can (not in an
exported tree). It sees runtime behavior only through live check results you supply in a
`--live` file.

cca is the pair of `ccx-loop`: the loop builds and publishes one unit of work, cca
audits what was built, across units.

Built against Claude Code 2.1.284. The static checks, fixture builds, and one budget-0 run
have passed, and `docs/history/claude-codex-audit/acceptance.md` in the reimagine-code
repository records five full multi-agent audit runs on the
`patterns` and `ground-truth` fixtures, under Claude Code 2.1.287.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with plugin agents and the Agent tool's `model` option.
- `git` 2.29 or later (the fetch commands use an empty `--refmap=`). Each audited repo
  is a local clone.
- For GitHub bundles, `gh` 2.73.0 or later, authenticated, and `jq`. An older `gh` stops
  stage 1 with its "Unknown JSON field" message, because stage 1 asks for the pull
  requests that close a ticket. A bundle repo whose remote for the PR or ticket is an
  SSH remote on a host other than github.com needs `gh` 2.81.0 or later, unless the id
  is given as a URL. `jq` is also what validates `work-items.jsonl`; without it, the
  report's Coverage says the file was not validated.
  For any other forge, or without a forge CLI, supply ticket and thread text as exported files (see Exported forge
  files); the report then says the forge was not queried.
- `jq` for `/cca:resume --live`, on any forge. Without it, the import stops before it
  keeps anything.
- Optional: the Codex CLI and the `ccx` plugin, 0.1.0 or later, for the second
  opinion. ccx runs Codex from the session's repository root, with no network
  access.

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add vibecodedapps-official/reimagine-code
/plugin install cca@reimagine-code
```

To try a local clone without installing it:

```
git clone https://github.com/vibecodedapps-official/reimagine-code.git
claude --plugin-dir <path-to-clone>/plugins/cca
```

## Before the first run

Size the sources before the first run. Any repo that is not checked out cleanly at its
pinned sha is exported into the run directory, and an export copies every tracked blob at
that sha. Its size is the sum of the sizes that
`git -C <repo> ls-tree -r -l --full-tree <ref>` lists. An export over 1 GB asks first.

Agents run no test or lint command in an exported tree. When a repo's tests matter to the
audit, check out the pinned sha cleanly so the repo is read directly.

## Commands

```
/cca:audit [<manifest.json>] [<inputs...>] [--effort low|medium|high]
           [--no-codex] [--codex-model <id>] [--models role=model,...]
           [--questions <file>] [--claims <file>]... [--budget <minutes>]
           [--max-agents <n>] [--codex-timeout <seconds>]
/cca:resume <run-id> [--from <stage>] [--live <file>]
/cca:act <run-id> <item-id...> [--per-item]
/cca:handoff [<manifest.json>] [<inputs...>] [--out <path>] [--verdicts <claims-verdicts.md>]
           [--memory <dir>]
```

- `/cca:handoff` runs in the build session and writes a typed handoff for `/cca:audit`.
- `/cca:audit` runs stages 1 to 8 and stops at the report.
- `/cca:resume` reruns a run from a stage, reusing only the stages whose inputs have not
  changed, and with `--live` feeds approved live check results back into it.
- `/cca:act` runs stage 9 on the items you approve.

An unknown flag or a bad value is rejected in one line, and nothing is written.

### `/cca:audit` flags

| Flag | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--effort` | `low`, `medium`, or `high`; overrides the tier cca picks | picked from the bundle's size (see Effort) |
| `--no-codex` | none; the fallback reviewer gives the second opinion | Codex, when available |
| `--codex-model` | a full Codex model id | `gpt-6.1-sol` |
| `--codex-timeout` | seconds, 1 to 3600 | by tier: low 1,200, medium 2,400, high 3,600 |
| `--models` | `role=model,...`, roles `digester`, `mapper`, `auditor`, `adversary`, `merger`, models as the Agent tool accepts them (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`) | see Roles |
| `--questions` | a markdown file of `id: question` lines | the four default questions |
| `--claims` | a claims file; repeat the flag for more | none |
| `--budget` | a soft wall-clock budget in minutes; `0` expires once stage 1 completes | no budget |
| `--max-agents` | the most subagents running at once across the run | 8 |

Prompt inputs are repo paths, PR and ticket ids (`github:owner/repo#n`, `#n` when the
repo has one GitHub remote, or `file:<path>`), and files, and they merge with the
manifest. Relative paths in the prompt are relative to the session's directory. cca
states the merged, normalized manifest before stage 1 and saves it in the run directory.

### `/cca:resume`

`--from <stage>` takes a stage number from 1 to 8. Resume reruns from the earlier of
`--from` and the first stage that is incomplete or whose inputs changed, reruns every
stage after it, and marks their old outputs superseded. Approvals you gave are not
asked again, except that a fetch approval covers only the commands it listed (an
approval for a bare name covers either candidate refspec for it); other fetch
commands are asked again. If any bundle's head or base has moved since the run
started, resume stops and asks whether to restart from stage 1, since the brief's base
commit list and overlap set depend on the base tip. A GitHub PR's base is the local
`<remote>/<base branch>` ref, which stage 1 always asks to refresh, not GitHub's cached
`baseRefOid`. Resume also re-queries the forge data the
brief used; a difference invalidates stage 1, and if the forge cannot be queried,
resume stops. A run directory with `manifest.json` but no `stages.json` reruns from
stage 1; one without `manifest.json` is unrecoverable.

`--live <file>` feeds the results of approved live checks back into a finished run (see
Live data below). It takes an existing file, once, and is rejected with `--from` 1 to 5.
It is also refused, without asking, when the run has no finished stage 1 or no report, or
when a bundle's head or base has moved: run `/cca:resume <run-id>` first, which may ask to
restart.

### `/cca:act`

Item ids are the report's `C<n>` ids. Act never widens the list you give it.
`--per-item` makes one commit per item instead of one per ticket per repo. See Stage 9.

### `/cca:handoff`

Run it in the build session, before the audit. It takes the same input forms as
`/cca:audit` and rejects a bad argument in one line, writing nothing.

- `--out <path>`: where to write the handoff. It must be outside every repo or ignored by
  its repo. Without it, the file goes to `<scratch>/cca/handoff-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md` in
  the session's repository, with `<scratch>` chosen as in Run directory, and `-2`, `-3`
  added when that file exists. With neither, the command stops and asks for `--out`. An
  existing file is never overwritten: an `--out` that names one stops the command.
- `--verdicts <claims-verdicts.md>`: a return-trip file from an earlier audit. It is read
  first. A line whose file hash and claim text match the handoff source it names is
  applied; a mismatch is listed as reconciliation work and not applied.
- `--memory <dir>`: a directory of the build session's memory files; it needs `--verdicts`
  and an existing directory. For each `false` entry it lists the files under `<dir>` that
  mention the entry's ticket id, quoted names, numbers, shas, or issue ids, grouped by
  claim, as memory reconciliation work. It never edits those files.

The command settles each bundle's base first: the manifest's `base`, else the PR's base
branch, else the repository's default branch, which it asks you to confirm. It never uses
the branch's upstream tracking ref as the base. It gathers the record (the commit
messages from the merge-base to the head, the forge fields of each ticket, and the
session's own checkpoint record) and writes the handoff from that record only. A deferral
stays a deferral. Where the record shows no alternative was weighed, it writes
`options: none recorded`, and never invents one. It then runs `handoff.sh check` on the
file, fixes and reruns at most three times, and prints the path, the corrections applied,
the reconciliation list, and the `/cca:audit ... --claims <path>` command to run next.
It never edits tracked files, commits, or posts anything.

## Manifest

Inputs come from a manifest file, from the prompt, or both. Relative paths in a manifest
are relative to the manifest's directory.

```json
{
  "bundles": [
    { "repo": "../app", "pr": "github:owner/app#123", "base": "origin/main",
      "tickets": ["github:owner/app#159", "file:./exports/ab-4567.md"] }
  ],
  "references": [
    { "name": "legacy", "path": "../legacy-app", "ref": "main" }
  ],
  "sources_of_truth": [
    { "rank": 1, "name": "legacy source", "path": "../legacy-app", "ref": "main" },
    { "rank": 2, "name": "guidelines", "path": "../guidelines", "ref": "main" }
  ],
  "claims": ["./session-summary.md"],
  "scratch": "../app/.scratch",
  "forge_exports": { "command": "az boards work-item show --id 4567",
                     "exported_at": "2026-09-29" },
  "groups": [
    { "name": "auth", "repo": "../app", "files": ["src/auth/**"] }
  ],
  "questions": "default",
  "models": { "adversary": "opus", "merger": "sonnet" }
}
```

- **`bundles`.** A repo path plus a PR (`pr`), a branch (`branch`), or both, and a base
  (`base`), with the bundle's `tickets`. A PR resolves its head branch and base from the
  forge. A bundle whose `pr` is a `file:` export must also give `branch` and `base`,
  since no forge resolves them. When the manifest gives a branch or base that disagrees
  with the PR, the run stops before stage 1 and shows both. A bundle with no resolvable
  base is rejected. Short ids such as `#159` are accepted only when the bundle's repo has
  one GitHub remote; otherwise ids are written `github:owner/repo#n` or `file:<path>`.
  A bundle may add `ticket_token`, a string or a list of strings, each a literal template
  with `{n}` once, such as `"#{n}"` or `["#{n}", "AB#{n}"]`. For its exported tickets,
  stage 1 then matches commit messages by the template with `{n}` replaced by the
  ticket's `id`, in place of the bare `id`, so a bare-number id matches `#4567` but not
  `build 4567 passed`. The boundary rule applies outside the whole token, so `#{n}` does
  not match `AB#4567`; list `AB#{n}` too for that. GitHub tickets keep their own rule.
  A bundle may add `run_once`, a glob pattern or a list of them, repo-relative and using
  git's glob pathspec rules (`*` does not cross `/`, `**` does), such as
  `["migrations/*.sql", "db/scripts/**/*.sql"]`. Stage 1 lists the bundle's changed files
  that match, with whether each exists at the merge-base, for the auditors. There is no
  default.
  A bundle may add `"head": "working-tree"` (a manifest key only; its one value) to audit
  uncommitted work. The bundle's branch must be checked out, and stage 1 builds a commit
  from the working tree, with the modified files and the untracked files that are not
  ignored, as the bundle's head. See Read-only boundary.
  A bundle may add `test_command` and `test_run` to have stage 1 run its changed test
  files with the change reverted. Each file under `test_run` that the bundle added or
  changed runs twice, as `sh -c '<test_command> "$1"' sh <path>`: once in a copy of the
  head, and once in a copy of the merge-base with the test code at its head state. A file
  that passes in both does not detect the change. For example:
  `"test_command": "pytest -v", "test_run": "tests/**/test_*.py"`. Optional keys:
  `test_paths` (globs for test code, which keeps its head state in the reverted copy;
  the default covers `test/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, and names like `test_*`, `*_test`,
  `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, and `*Test.*`), `test_setup` (a command run once in each copy
  first, such as `npm ci`; without it a copy holds tracked files only), and
  `test_timeout` (seconds per command, default 300). At most 20 files and 30 minutes run
  per bundle. A partial clone (`--filter`) stops stage 1 with
  `revert-tests: partial clones are not supported`. Setting `test_command` is your
  consent to run the bundle's own commands:
  they run with your environment and credentials, as a test run in your checkout does,
  in copies under cca's data directory that are removed afterwards. Set it only for a
  suite that reaches no live system, and have `test_setup` install into the copy (a
  virtual environment, `npm ci`), not a shared interpreter. A tool cache outside the copy
  may be written. Output is recorded unredacted in the run directory, where agents read
  it and the report may quote it. A process that leaves its process group (a daemon),
  and on Windows a native program's own children, may keep running after the step ends.
- **`references`.** Read-only repos consulted only when a question needs them, each with
  a `name`, a `path`, and a `ref`. Each is pinned to the sha its `ref` resolves to in
  stage 1.
- **`sources_of_truth`.** Ranked sources, each with a `rank`, a `name`, a `path`, and a
  `ref`. Rank decides which side wins a conflict and how findings are labeled. The
  default order is legacy source code, then a guidelines corpus, then the audited repo's
  own docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`), then ticket text. Legacy and
  guidelines are included only when supplied. A manifest that lists `sources_of_truth`
  replaces the default, and the brief states the order used. Each is pinned to a sha in
  stage 1.
- **`claims`.** One or more files to verify, such as the build session's summary or a
  `ccx-loop` run's `report.md`, or a handoff written by `/cca:handoff`. Claims are never a source
  of truth. `--claims` adds to these. See Handoff and claims.
- **`scratch`.** An ignored directory inside the primary repo, under any name, where the
  run directory goes, to keep it in the repo. See Run directory.
- **`forge_exports`.** The `command` used to export forge files and the date
  (`exported_at`). It is a record only; cca never runs it.
- **`groups`.** Optional review groups, each with a `name`, a `repo`, and `files` globs
  relative to that repo. When present, it replaces the groups cca would derive. A file
  matching two entries goes to both with a note; changed files no entry matches go to an
  `unticketed` group. Each name is lowercased, with runs of characters outside `a-z0-9`
  turned into one `-`, and the run stops before stage 1 if the slug is empty, is a reserved scope name
  (`tests`, `hygiene`, `tests-hygiene`, `interactions`, `combined`, `unticketed`),
  is shared by two entries, or equals `<scope>-topup` or `<scope>-maptopup`, where
  `<scope>` is another entry's slug or a reserved scope name.
- **`questions`.** `"default"` for the four default questions, or a path to a questions
  file, as for `--questions`.
- **`models`.** Per-role model overrides, as for `--models`.

### Exported forge files

For a forge cca does not query, supply one file per ticket or PR, as markdown with a
frontmatter block or as JSON, and name it as `file:<path>`.

- A ticket requires `id`, `url`, `title`, `state`, and `description`, and may have
  `acceptance_criteria`, `fields` (name and value), `links`, and `comments` (author,
  date, text).
- A PR requires `id`, `url`, `title`, and `body`, and may have `reviews` and `threads`
  (file, line, comments).
- Every file requires the provenance keys `source`, `exported_by`, and `exported_at`.

A missing required key stops the run before stage 1 with `export <path>: missing <key>`.
A missing optional key is listed in the audit brief as "not in export", and the
work-item hygiene review reports it.

## Audit questions

- `Q1` best practice: does the change follow the ranked sources and the repo's own
  conventions?
- `Q2` semantic drift: does the code do what the ticket and the claims say, no more and
  no less?
- `Q3` technical debt: what does the change leave for later, and is that recorded?
- `Q4` decision quality: were the choices the change made the right ones, which
  alternatives existed, and which does the auditor recommend, with the reason?

`--questions <file>` takes a markdown list of `id: question` lines that replaces the
four. A line `extends: default` keeps the four and adds yours.

## Handoff and claims

A claims file is a statement of what the build session says it did. cca checks it and
never takes it as true. `/cca:handoff` writes the claims in a typed form, and stage 1 reads
a prose claims file as typed claims too, one kind per sentence. The handoff format is in
`skills/cca/handoff.md`; `/cca:audit` validates a handoff with `handoff.sh` before stage 1
and stops with the script's error lines when it does not pass.

**Claim kinds.**

- `verification`: says something was checked, tested, verified, confirmed, reproduced, or
  passes.
- `decision`: states a choice made or rejected, a deferral, or who decided.
- `scope`: says what belongs in or out of the bundle, or ranks a ticket for inclusion.
- `status`: a work item's type, state, iteration, owner, or links.
- `code`: any other checkable statement about code, data, or behavior.

For prose, the first kind that fits, in the order above, wins. A handoff's kinds come from
`handoff.sh claims`, not from judgment. Every `scope` and `status` claim goes to the
`hygiene` scope. A handoff's commit lists also seed the review groups, along with the
commit messages.

**Verification rule.** A `verification` claim is `true` only when the audit reproduced the
stated result itself, by a run, or by a quote when the stated result is a fact of the code
at the pinned sha. A claim the audit cannot reproduce is `not verified` with the reason
`not reproduced` (not run, no access, needs a live check, budget expired, exported
tree, or setup differs). It is never `true`, and it is not `false` either: `false` is
kept for counter-evidence, and a run under a different setup than the check needs is not
counter-evidence. The pass-two adversary re-checks every verification claim marked
`true`. Reproducing a result does not show that the build session ran its check, and the
report says so once.

**Decision classes.** Each `decision` claim lands in one class: `stale deferral` (an open
deferral with no named person or that nothing tracks), `needs <owner>` (a tracked deferral
with a named person, or a hard-to-reverse or contract-changing choice no person decided),
`default taken` (a taken decision with no alternative weighed in a record the audit can
read), or `evidenced`. Each has a reversibility class: `reversible`, `hard to reverse`, or
`contract change`. Decision entries are report items, not findings: they never enter the
ledger or change the verdict counts. When an entry shows a defect, the auditor files a
separate finding for it.

**Scope check.** For each raised ticket (a `scope` claim) the hygiene scope answers
whether the bundle introduced the behavior, whether the fix lies inside the bundle's repos,
and what it costs. It then recommends `include` or `defer`, and records whether its facts
or its recommendation differ from the handoff's ranking. Report section 8 holds the
decision ledger, the raised tickets, and the other decisions.

**`claims-verdicts.md`.** Stage 8 writes it next to `report.md`, with the report's
revision. It has one entry per claim of each claims file, in claim order, grouped by file
(each group names the file's hash). An entry is a main line with the claim number, kind,
source line, handoff ref, verdict (`true`, `false`, `not verified`,
`not reproducible here`, or `contested`),
finding ids, and a pointer to the evidence, followed by three indented sub-lines,
`ticket:` (the claim's ticket id, or `none`), `text:`, and `correction:` (a correction or
`none`). The text and the correction sit on their own lines so a `; ` inside them cannot
be misread. A file from 0.2.0 has no `ticket:` sub-line. `false` entries are corrections.
`not verified` lines on verification claims are recheck requests, not evidence the
statement is wrong. `not reproducible here` lines are not recheck requests: the check
was tagged `env: <name>;` and ran against an environment the audit cannot reach, so run
it there and feed the result back with `/cca:resume <run-id> --live <file>`; applying
the file changes nothing for such a line. `contested` entries need a person to decide.

To apply it, run `/cca:handoff --verdicts <claims-verdicts.md>` in the build session. A
line is applied only when its file hash and claim text match the handoff source it names;
a mismatch is listed as reconciliation work. A build session that keeps a memory of its
own work should treat the `false` lines as the entries to correct, so a wrong premise
does not seed the next session.

### Work-item operations

Stage 8 also writes `work-items.jsonl`: one JSON object per operation, ids `W1`, `W2`, and
so on, for a forge adapter or a person to apply. An operation can create a ticket
(`$new:<key>` is a placeholder for an id that does not exist yet), set a field (by the
forge's own field name) or state, add a link or comment, or set a description,
acceptance criteria, or PR description, update a comment, remove a link, or set several
fields. Text can carry `{mention:<key>}` placeholders for people, and an operation that
exists only to support another cites it as `W<n>`. The format is in
`skills/cca/work-items.md`.
`sh skills/cca/scripts/work-items.sh check` (it needs `jq`) validates the file against
the report body and `claims.md` before the report is hashed, and the result goes in the
report's Coverage. cca writes and validates the plan. No adapter ships, and `/cca:act`
applies none of it.

## Stages

1. **Orient.** Resolve the manifest, fetch forge data or read exports, record head,
   base, and merge-base shas, dump a three-dot diff per bundle (a two-dot diff is never
   used, since it shows the base's later changes as reversals), pin every reference and
   source, split the claims into numbered, typed claims, and map every changed file to a
   review group. For a bundle with `test_command`, run its changed test files with the
   change reverted (see Manifest).
2. **Digest.** Digester agents turn each document corpus among the sources into a cited
   rule list. Not applicable without a document corpus.
3. **Domain map.** Mapper agents answer per-ticket questions against each code base
   among the sources. Not applicable without one.
4. **Pass one.** One auditor per review group, plus the specialists the tier adds.
   Stages 2, 3, and 4 start together, and a top-up auditor covers any digest or map a
   group's auditor missed.
5. **Pass two.** A fresh adversary per pass-one report opens every citation, looks for
   counter-evidence, and rules on each finding. `ledger.sh` builds the finding sections
   of `ledger/5.md` from the pass-one and pass-two files on disk.
6. **Second opinion.** Codex, or the fallback, reviews every finding, including dropped
   ones, and may restore findings or add new ones. Every blocker, high, medium, and
   downgraded or dropped finding must get a position, in batches of at most 60 ids
   (Codex takes two batches; the fallback takes any further ones). A low or note finding
   needs only the acknowledgment that the second opinion received it.
7. **Converge.** A late adversary challenges late additions (at medium and high), then
   a merger folds the ledger into one item per distinct defect, `C1`, `C2`, and so on.
   `ledger.sh` builds the review gate (`gate.md`) from the ledger files and checks that
   `gate.md` matches it and that every id is absorbed by exactly one converged item with
   a matching gate. Evidence, the condensed positions, dedupe, and the severity and
   contested checks stay with the models.
8. **Report.** The verdict and the report, written from what is on disk. Stage 8 writes
   three outputs: `report.md`, `claims-verdicts.md` (see Handoff and claims), and
   `work-items.jsonl` (see Work-item operations).
9. **Act.** Only through `/cca:act`, on items you approve.

A finding **counts** toward the verdict only when a reviewer other than its author has
challenged it and the second opinion has seen it. "Seen" depends on severity, taken after
pass two: a blocker, high, or medium finding needs a position from the second opinion,
while a low or note finding may count on the second opinion's acknowledgment alone. A
finding the second opinion added counts once the late adversary has challenged it.
Anything else is **provisional** and does not count. Reviewers who disagree are both kept,
as a `contested` item; cca never picks a side.

The verdict is `not ready`, `merge after fixes`, or `ready to merge`, from the items that
count. An incomplete audit says `audit incomplete` and never `ready to merge`.

## Roles

| Role | Default | Fallback when the default fails |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator | the session's model, in the main session | none; the run ends `blocked` |
| Digester (stage 2) | `cca:digester` agent, Opus | retry once, then the same agent on Fable, else the stage fails |
| Domain mapper (stage 3) | `cca:mapper` agent, Opus | as for the digester |
| Auditor (stage 4) | `cca:auditor` agent, Opus | as for the digester |
| Adversary (stage 5) | `cca:adversary` agent, Opus, fresh context | as for the digester |
| Second opinion (stage 6) | Codex `gpt-6.1-sol` through ccx | `cca:adversary` on Fable, else Opus |
| Merger (stage 7) | `cca:merger` agent, Sonnet | the orchestrator |

A fallback swaps who fills a role; it never removes a stage. Every swap is named in the
report. The report records the requested model for each agent and says "requested", not
"used", because cca does not collect the effective model.

## Effort

Effort sets how the work is split and how deep pass two digs. At every tier, every
question is asked, every applicable source is read, every changed file is reviewed,
every claim is checked, and stages 5 and 6 run.

The tier is the first row whose conditions all hold. `--effort` overrides it, and the
audit brief states the tier and why.

| Tier | Conditions | Pass one | Pass two on Verified OK | Late adversary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| low | 1 bundle, 1 ticket, under 500 changed lines | one auditor covering the ticket, tests, and work-item hygiene | no | only when `live/` lists ids; otherwise late additions stay provisional |
| medium | up to 3 bundles, up to 5 tickets, under 5,000 changed lines | one auditor per group, plus one for tests and work-item hygiene, plus cross-bundle interactions when there is more than one bundle | up to 5 items per report | yes |
| high | anything else | one per group, plus tests, plus work-item hygiene, plus cross-bundle interactions when there is more than one bundle | all items | yes |

At low, one auditor covers the ticket, tests, and hygiene with the same checklist, and
the report says so.

## Run directory

The **primary repo** is the session's repository if it is one of the bundles, otherwise
the first bundle. The run directory is `<scratch>/cca/<run-id>/`, where `<scratch>` is
the first of: the manifest's `scratch` key, a directory the primary repo already ignores
and uses for scratch (`scratch/`, `tmp/`, `.scratch/`), then `.cca/` if the primary repo
ignores it, else `runs/` in cca's plugin data directory. The `scratch` key must name a
path inside the primary repo that the repo ignores (`git check-ignore` succeeds); a
missing directory is created. Otherwise the run stops before stage 1 with
`scratch <path>: not an ignored path inside <primary repo>`. A resumed run keeps its recorded
directory, even when the manifest's `scratch` has changed since. The run id is
`<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>`, with a numeric suffix on collision. Every run is recorded in
`runs.json` in cca's plugin data directory, so `/cca:resume` and `/cca:act` find it from
any directory, unless Claude Code refuses the write, which the run reports.

The run directory holds all state: the normalized `manifest.json`, `stages.json` (the
only record of which stages are complete), `audit-brief.md`, `claims.md`, `groups.md`,
the diffs, the per-stage outputs, the ledger files, `converged.md`, `report.md`,
`claims-verdicts.md`, `work-items.jsonl`, `act/log.md`, `usage.md`, and
`invocations.md` (each invocation's block, appended verbatim, which a run re-reads after a
context compaction; a run from 0.4.0 or earlier has none). A crashed or
interrupted run loses no finished stage, and `/cca:resume` never reuses a stale one.

### Terminal states

- `reported`: every applicable stage complete.
- `partial`: a report was written, but a stage failed or the budget ran out. The verdict
  is `audit incomplete`, and cca prints a resume command.
- `blocked`: no report could be written, or the read-only check failed. The reason is
  printed and every finished stage file is kept.

The run stops by printing the report path, the verdict, and the terminal state.

## Read-only boundary

During `/cca:audit` and `/cca:resume`, nothing changes an audited repo's tracked files,
untracked non-ignored files, the index, branches, tags, stashes, config, or remotes. An
audited repo is every bundle, reference, and source of truth. The only writes are the
run directory, `runs.json`, the `runs.json.lock` directory and temporary file beside
`runs.json`, ccx's own request and thread files in its data directory, and an explicit `git fetch --no-tags --refmap=` into remote-tracking refs after you
approve the listed commands (a remote configured with `remote.<name>.prune` may also
delete stale remote-tracking refs). A bundle with `test_command` adds the copies its
stage 1 test run makes under cca's data directory, removed when it ends, and whatever
those test commands write outside the audited repos; the report discloses both. An
ignored file written by a run that an agent logged is allowed and reported. That attribution is self-reported: it rests on the
agent's own `runs:` list, and it is repo-level, so any logged run in a repo accounts for
any ignored-file change in that repo.

When a repo's checkout is not at the audited sha, or has changes, cca exports the exact
tree into the run directory from git objects, so no checkout filter or attribute runs and
nothing is written to the repo. Symlinks are exported as placeholder files holding their
target, and submodules are listed, not exported. An export over 1 GB is asked about
first.

A bundle with `head: working-tree` writes one more thing to its repo: the loose git
objects of a commit that `skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh build` makes from the working
tree in a temporary index, a copy of the repo's own, so a file you staged with
`git add -f` despite an ignore rule is kept. The repo's index, refs, and files are not
touched, and the commit has no ref, so `git gc` may prune it after its prune window; the
report's Coverage says so, and lists the files untracked at audit time. A skip-worktree or
assume-unchanged path is built at its index version, whatever its file on disk holds; the
brief and Coverage list it as flagged, and agents read the bundle from an export of its
head, never the local file (a flagged path in a submodule is absent from the export, as
every submodule path is). One flagged path is enough to make the bundle an export, and no
test runs in an export. If the bundle's tests matter, clear the flag before the run
(`git update-index --no-skip-worktree <path>`, or `--no-assume-unchanged <path>`); the
head then holds that file's local content, so leave the flag on a file such as local
credentials. The read-only check does not compare a flagged file's content, so a change
to one during the run may escape it. The script refuses (exit 1, before it writes
anything) a repo with no `HEAD` commit, a repo or checked-out submodule with no
index file, a sparse checkout in the top level or a checked-out submodule, flagged paths
the build cannot hold at the index version (a flagged submodule or intent-to-add entry, a
path that is a directory on disk or lies under a symlink or a file, or a path git prints
quoted, which cannot be checked on disk), unmerged paths, a submodule with changes, an
untracked nested repository, a Git LFS or program filter, or a path git prints quoted. Its
`check` mode runs only these refusal checks, which run no filter or hook and write
nothing, and stage 1 runs it before the read-only baseline, so a program filter never
runs. The same working tree and `HEAD` give the same commit sha, so `/cca:resume` rebuilds
the head and does not ask to restart. With no flagged path, agents search such a tree with
`git grep <pattern> <head sha>`.

Role agents' tool lists exclude Edit and NotebookEdit. Each agent has Write, limited by
instruction to its own output file in the run directory; the read-only check after every
stage, described below, is the guard that detects a change to an audited repo and stops
the run. Agents with Bash are told to run only read commands (`git show`, `git log`,
`git diff <base>...<head>`, `git grep`, `git ls-files`, `rg`, `ls`) and, when a question
needs a run, the repo's test or lint commands. That is instruction, not enforcement: cca
has no mechanical block on Bash. Instead cca detects changes, with a script the
orchestrator runs rather than a procedure it follows by hand:
`skills/cca/scripts/readonly.sh`. In stage 1,
`snapshot` records each audited repo (status, refs, stash, local config, content hashes
of modified and untracked files, and an inventory of ignored files with sub-second
modification times) and a marker file. After every stage, `check` snapshots again and
prints the differences. A change to tracked files, untracked non-ignored files, refs,
index, stash, or config stops the run `blocked` and shows it (exit status 1). A check
that could not complete, such as a missing baseline file, also stops the run `blocked`
(exit 2). A change among ignored files, or a new remote-tracking ref, is accepted only
when a logged agent run or an approved fetch accounts for it (exit 3). A file newer than
the marker that is neither ignored nor changed in content is listed as touched and does
not stop the run. The git commands cca and its agents issue themselves run without an
index write during an audit or resume: the script sets `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`, the stages
run `git status` with `--no-optional-locks`, and agents run neither `git status` nor a
working-tree diff (a working-tree `git diff` refreshes the index even with that flag). A repo's own
test or lint command, which agents may run in a directly read tree, can run git itself
and is not covered. Stage 9 (act) is the write phase and is outside this boundary.

Nested repositories count as part of the audited repo: a checked-out submodule, or an
untracked directory with its own `.git`, at any depth. The snapshot records each one's
status, HEAD, changed and untracked files, and ignored files, with paths from the top
level, whatever the submodule's `ignore` setting. Every file under a submodule that is not
checked out is hashed, since git does not look there. The status leaves out the count of
commits ahead of and behind the upstream, so a fetch that moves the upstream shows only as
a remote-tracking ref. Where the repo's `core.ignorecase` is true, the run directory is
matched without regard to case.

The script does not support a file name that git prints quoted, even with
`core.quotePath=false`: one holding a double quote, a backslash, a tab, a newline, or
another control character. It exits 2 naming the path. Rename the file or leave it out of
the audited repo.

What is not detected:

- an ignored file replaced with one of the same size and a restored modification time,
  to the precision `stat` reports (sub-second where the system gives it, else seconds);
- changes inside `.git/` other than refs, stashes, and config;
- in a nested repository, a change to a ref other than its HEAD, to its stashes, or to its
  config;
- a change inside a repository that sits in an ignored directory, such as a linked
  worktree, other than an entry added or removed at its top level;
- a `.git` created inside a directory the repo already tracks, which the scan prunes and
  does not report as a nested repository;
- changes outside the audited repos.

The report says so. Do not edit an audited repo during a run: your own edits trip the
check too.

## Codex is optional

The second opinion (stage 6) goes to Codex through ccx when the Codex CLI and
ccx are installed. Without them, with `--no-codex`, or when a Codex call is
refused, times out, or fails twice, the role is swapped to a fresh `cca:adversary` agent on Fable, else Opus,
given the same request (one launch per batch of at most 60 mandatory ids). The swap is named in the
report. Stage 6 always runs.

cca never runs the `codex` CLI itself, except `codex --version` to check it is there.
The request names every input by absolute path, and Codex acknowledges each input with
its sentinel. Only an input it could not open goes inline, in the one follow-up (a file,
`codex/followup.md`), under a 450,000-byte cap. When an input went unacknowledged, the
follow-up's text is passed in the call itself, since Codex may not open the file;
otherwise Codex reads the file by path. Over the cap, the follow-up is not sent and
stage 6 fails.

Codex reads a file outside every repo, such as a run directory in the plugin's data
directory, by absolute path. That read was verified on Windows with ccx's elevated
sandbox only (`docs/history/claude-codex-audit/decisions.md`, "Absolute-path Codex
requests"); on Linux and macOS it
relies on Codex's documented read-only policy. To stay clear of it, keep the run
directory inside a repo: use an ignored in-repo scratch directory, or the manifest
`scratch` key.

## Live data and external text

- **Live data.** Credentials and live systems (databases, dashboards, production APIs)
  are used only when a question cannot be answered from code, and only on a result you
  supply in a `--live` file after approving the access. cca never asks for live access during a run, and no agent or the
  orchestrator uses it. A check a question needs becomes an item in the report's Live
  checks section, with the query, where it runs, and what each result would mean; the
  finding stays an unverified assumption, capped at medium, until a live result for it
  has passed the review gate. Approvals come only from a `--live` file, which names who
  approved the access, and each access is logged in the report. A verification check tagged
  `env: <name>;` in a handoff is listed there too, by claim number, and is never `true`
  or `false` from a run in this environment.
- **Live results.** Run an approved check yourself, then write its result in a `--live`
  file and run `/cca:resume <run-id> --live <file>`. Per check the file gives the finding
  id (or `claim <n>` for an env claim), the query as the report states it, the environment
  for a claim, where it ran, the result, who approved the access, and when; the format is
  in `skills/cca/live.md`. A result longer than one line, such as the rows a query
  returns, goes in a file named by `result_file: <path>`, under the directory of the
  `--live` file; the import keeps a copy of it, hashed, and the reviewers read that copy.
  Resume checks the file against the report's revision and the query, records each
  approval, and rederives the finding's label and severity or the claim's verdict. A
  changed finding goes back to the second opinion and the late adversary, and stays
  provisional until both have seen it. Resume then writes a new report with a new
  revision, so an approval given to `/cca:act` against the old one no longer matches. A
  result for an `X<n>` or `L<n>` finding is kept with the finding, since a rerun renumbers
  those ids. A later resume that reruns from stage 5 or earlier retires the imported
  results, which stay on disk as the record.
- **External text.** Anything cca drafts for outside use (commit messages, PR or ticket
  text, and comments) names no model, agent, or tool. The report is internal and may
  name them.

## Stage 9: act

`/cca:act <run-id> <item-id...>` shows each approved item with the report's revision and
asks you to confirm. Approval is bound to the run, the revision, and the items; if the
report changed since, act stops. Each affected checkout must be on the bundle's branch
with no uncommitted changes; act never stashes or resets. New commits on the branch that
act did not make are shown as drift before it goes on. For a `head: working-tree` bundle,
drift means the committed tree differs from the audited tree, since the audited head is
not on any branch; commit ancestry does not apply, so committing the audited working tree
as is, or amending its message, is not drift.

Act runs the repo's required checks first as a baseline, then makes one local commit per
ticket per repo (or per item with `--per-item`), rerunning the checks for each and asking
before each commit. A check the change breaks is marked introduced and that commit is
not offered until you decide; a failure present at baseline is reported as preexisting.
Act never pushes and never edits tickets or PRs until you say to for that item. Every
action is logged in `act/log.md` in the run directory.

## Budget and usage

`--max-agents` caps concurrent subagents; extra work is queued, never merged or dropped.
`--budget` is soft: when it runs out, running agents finish, no new stage from 2 to 7
starts, the report is written from what is on disk, and the run ends `partial` with a
resume command. cca prints elapsed time and agents run at each stage boundary.

`usage.md` records per stage the agents run, their requested models, wall-clock time,
and tokens as reported in each agent's completion notification. Every token number is
labeled with its source; the scope of that number is not documented by the platform,
and the label says so. Codex usage through ccx is "not reported". No total is
presented as exact.

## Pairing with ccx-loop

When a `ccx-loop` run has a commit of its own, it writes
`.ccx/<run-id>/handoff.md` and `.ccx/<run-id>/cca-manifest.json` and suggests
`/cca:audit "<absolute path of .ccx/<run-id>/cca-manifest.json>"`. The manifest carries
the bundles and tickets, with the typed handoff as its claims.

## Development

The plugin is prompt files and eight small shell scripts under `skills/cca/scripts/`
(`readonly.sh`, `handoff.sh`, `work-items.sh`, `working-tree.sh`, `live.sh`, `memory.sh`,
`ledger.sh`, and `revert-tests.sh`): commands, one orchestrator skill with its stage
files and templates, and five agent definitions. The scripts are:

- `readonly.sh`: snapshots an audited repo and checks it later for changes.
- `handoff.sh`: validates a handoff and lists its claims and commits.
- `work-items.sh`: validates `work-items.jsonl` against the report and `claims.md`.
- `working-tree.sh`: builds a commit from a working tree, or checks that it can.
- `live.sh`: validates, imports, and reconciles `--live` results.
- `memory.sh`: lists the memory files that mention a claim the audit found false.
- `ledger.sh`: builds the finding sections of `ledger/5.md`, the mandatory and seen id
  lists, and `gate.md`, and checks the ledger files against the pass files, the Codex
  answers, and `converged.md`.
- `revert-tests.sh`: runs a bundle's changed test files in a copy of the head and in a
  copy of the merge-base with the test code at its head state, and writes a verdict per
  file.

Its checks live in `tests/cca/` of the reimagine-code repository. From its root,
`npm test` runs every one of them through `tests/cca/sh.test.mjs`, and `npm run lint`
runs the repository checks. Each can also run alone:

- `sh tests/cca/lint.sh`: checks the static parts (command and agent frontmatter, no agent
  with Edit or NotebookEdit, every stage file the skill names exists).
- `sh tests/cca/fixture/build.sh <solo|solo-dirty|full|tokens|patterns|ground-truth>`:
  builds a throwaway fixture in a temp directory and prints its manifest path. Expected
  outcomes are listed in `tests/cca/fixture/expected.md`. `ground-truth` plants the 20
  confirmed review findings of `tests/cca/fixture/ground-truth-cases.md`.
- `sh tests/cca/fixture/verify.sh <manifest path> [name]`: checks a built fixture against
  the key literals in `tests/cca/fixture/expected.md` and prints one line per mismatch. CI
  runs it after each build.
- `sh tests/cca/readonly.sh`: runs `readonly.sh` against a `solo-dirty` fixture, one case per
  kind of difference, and compares output and exit status with literals.
- `sh tests/cca/handoff.sh`: runs `handoff.sh` on the fixture handoff and on valid and broken
  copies, and compares claims, commits, and error lines with literals.
- `sh tests/cca/work-items.sh`: runs `work-items.sh` on a valid file and broken copies. It
  needs `jq`; without it, it prints a note and exits 0.
- `sh tests/cca/working-tree.sh`: runs `working-tree.sh` on copies of the solo fixture and on
  inline repos, with literal shas and refusal lines.
- `sh tests/cca/live.sh`: runs `live.sh` `check` on a valid `--live` file and broken copies,
  then each bookkeeping mode in a fresh run directory.
- `sh tests/cca/memory.sh`: runs `memory.sh find` on the solo fixture's verdicts and on inline
  verdicts files that cover each key grammar.
- `sh tests/cca/ledger.sh`: runs `ledger.sh` on inline ledger inputs and compares each op's
  output and exit status with literals.
- `sh tests/cca/revert-tests.sh`: runs `revert-tests.sh` on inline repos (each change status,
  odd paths, timeouts, caps, setup failures, an interrupt, and a run in the background
  through `bg` and `wait`) and on the `patterns` and
  `ground-truth` fixtures, and compares each verdict with a literal.

CI runs them on Linux, macOS, and Windows (under Git Bash), each fixture build and
verify once with a hostile global git config, and on Linux a second time with mawk
first on `PATH` as `awk`, since the default there is gawk. macOS runs them with its own
BSD awk.

Acceptance results are recorded in the repository's `docs/acceptance.md`, and the
records and decisions from before the plugin joined reimagine-code are kept under
`docs/history/claude-codex-audit/`. On Windows, run the scripts under Git Bash.
