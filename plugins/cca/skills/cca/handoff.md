# Handoff format

A handoff is the build session's typed record of a bundle of work: per ticket, its fields,
the problem, the decision, the commits, and what the session says it verified; per
decision, its rationale, options, who decided, where it is recorded, and its status; per
ticket raised during the work, how confident the session is that it belongs in the bundle.
`/cca:handoff` writes one. `/cca:audit` reads one given as a claims file (`--claims` or the
manifest's `claims`), checks it with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh`,
and turns every item into a typed claim. A handoff is a set of claims to verify, never a
source of truth.

This file is the single home of the format. `commands/handoff.md`,
`skills/cca/stages/1-orient.md`, and `skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh` follow it.

## Layout

A handoff is a UTF-8 markdown file. LF or CRLF line endings are accepted: one CR before each
LF is removed before parsing, and line numbers stay physical. A UTF-8 byte order mark at
the start of the first line is ignored. Every value sits on one line and holds no tab.

## Rules

1. The frontmatter is the first block: a `---` line, then exactly two keys, `cca-handoff: 1`
   and `generated:` with a non-empty value, then a `---` line. A `cca-handoff:` value other
   than `1` is an error ("unsupported handoff version").
2. The four `## ` sections appear once each, in this order: `## Bundles`, `## Tickets`,
   `## Decisions`, `## Raised tickets`. A section with no items holds the single line
   `none`, except `## Bundles`, which never holds `none` and needs at least one bundle,
   since every other item refers to one. A `# ` title line is allowed once, after the
   frontmatter and before `## Bundles`.
3. A bundle name is the cca bundle name: the repo directory's base name, lowercased, with
   `-2`, `-3` added in list order when two bundles share it. It matches
   `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*$`, so it holds no space, comma, or semicolon; a base name that
   does not fit is slugged (each run of other characters becomes one `-`). Bundle names are
   unique. A `## Bundles` line is split from the right: the last `; base `, then the last
   `; branch ` before it, then the last `; pr ` before that. What follows `: repo ` up to
   that point is the path, which may hold any character but a tab. The path, pr, branch,
   and base are not empty; pr is `none` when the bundle has no PR. A relative path is
   relative to the handoff file's directory; `/cca:handoff` writes absolute paths.
4. Item headings: tickets `### <ticket id>`, the id as the forge or export writes it, such
   as `APP-1`, `AB#4567`, or `github:owner/repo#12`; spaces and colons are allowed, and the
   id is the whole rest of the line after `### `. Decisions are `### D<n>` and raised
   tickets `### R<n>`, `<n>` a whole number from 1. Ids are unique within their section.
   Ticket ids are unique across the whole handoff: when two repos have a ticket with the
   same short id, both are written in their qualified form (such as
   `github:owner/app#12`). The `ticket` values in `## Raised tickets` are unique too, and
   none is an id in `## Tickets`. Every name in a `bundles:` value is a bundle from
   `## Bundles`, named once per value; a ticket in `## Tickets` lists at least one, and a
   raised ticket lists at least one or says `none`.
5. Item keys are `- <key>: <value>` at column 0, in the order listed above, with no other
   key. A listed key appears exactly once, and an optional key (`parent` and `links`, in
   tickets and raised tickets) at most once. Values are not empty. A list key (`commits`,
   `verified`, `options`, `links`) has an empty value followed by at least one entry
   indented exactly two spaces (`  - `), or the value `none` (`options` takes
   `none recorded` instead of `none`).
6. A commit entry is `  - <bundle name> <sha>: <text>`. The bundle is one of the ticket's
   `bundles`; the sha is 7 to 40 lowercase hex digits; the text is not empty. Within one
   ticket, two entries with the same bundle do not name the same commit: neither sha is a
   prefix of the other. One commit may appear under two tickets.
7. A verified entry is split at the first `; check: `; both parts are not empty. The check
   part says how the statement was checked, or `not recorded`. A check part that starts
   with `env:` is `env: <name>; <check>`, split at the first `;` after `env: `; the name
   and the check are not empty.
8. An options entry starts `chosen: ` or `rejected: `. A rejected entry is split at the
   first `; why: `, both parts not empty. At most one entry is `chosen:`. When `status` is
   `taken` or `default taken` and options are listed, exactly one is `chosen:`.
9. A decision's `ticket` resolves to a `### ` id in `## Tickets` first, else to the `ticket`
   value of an item in `## Raised tickets`; with neither, it is an error.
10. `status` is `taken`, `default taken`, `deferred`, or `deferred to <owner>` with a
    non-empty owner. `in_bundle_confidence` is `include`, `lean include`, `lean defer`, or
    `defer`. Ranks are distinct whole numbers from 1. `decided_by` is one of
    `person: <name>`, `role: <role>` (each with a non-empty value),
    `checkpoint (recommended option taken)`, or `not recorded`. `recorded_at` is one of
    `commit <sha>` (7 to 40 lowercase hex digits), `url <URL>`, `checkpoint: <where>` (each
    with a non-empty value), or `not recorded`.
11. `decided_by` is `person: <name>` only when the record names that person, and
    `role: <role>` when it names a role but no person. A model, agent, or tool is never
    `decided_by`. A choice taken at a checkpoint on the recommended option is
    `checkpoint (recommended option taken)`.
12. Blank lines are allowed anywhere. Any other line that fits none of the shapes above is
    an error.
13. A claim line, all six fields `claims` prints joined by tabs, is at most 8,000 bytes. A
    claim is read as one line, and a reader cannot page within a line, so a longer one is
    an error, never a truncation. The ids and bundle names in the other fields count, so a
    long id counts against the cap. A decision's claim joins its keys (decision, rationale,
    options, decided_by, recorded_at, status), so long options count too.
14. A links entry is `  - <type>: <target>`, split at the first `: `, both parts not
    empty, and no entry appears twice in one item. A parent is not the item's own ticket id
    (for a raised ticket, its `ticket` value). `parent` and `links` give the ticket's
    parent and linked work items, such as `closed by` a pull request, as the forge or
    export records them; `links: none` says the record shows no links.

## Writing a handoff

These rules are for the writer (`/cca:handoff`, or a person writing one by hand).

- Write from the record only: the commit bodies, the forge fields and comments, and the
  session's own checkpoint record. Never invent an option, a reason, or an owner.
- `parent` and `links` come only from the forge record: an export's `links` (and its
  parent link, or a parent in `fields`), or for a GitHub ticket its parent read and the
  pull requests that close it. Never infer them from PR or commit text. The handoff and
  the hygiene check, which reads the same forge data, cannot disagree.
- Where the record shows no alternative was weighed, write `options: none recorded`, and
  for a taken decision `status: default taken`. Keep a deferral's status: a deferred
  decision stays `deferred` or `deferred to <owner>`.
- A checkpoint choice the audit should count as weighed is recorded where the audit can
  read it, in a commit body or a ticket comment, and named in `recorded_at`. The audit
  cannot open a `checkpoint:` pointer.
- Put a statement the session checked under `verified`, with the exact check. The audit
  marks it `true` only when it reproduces the result itself. When the statement depends
  on it, the check also names what it needs to give the same result: the directory it
  ran in, environment variables, services or accounts, and the environment it ran against.
- Tag a check that ran against an environment the audit cannot reach, such as staging or
  production, as `check: env: <name>; <check>`, for example
  `check: env: staging; sh smoke.sh`.
- No credentials, tokens, or secrets anywhere in the file.

## Claims

`handoff.sh claims <file>` turns a valid handoff into one claim per line, six fields
separated by one tab: `<kind>`, `<ref>`, `<bundle>`, `<ticket>`, `<line>`, `<text>`. Items
are in file order, and within an item the claims are in this order:

| Item | Kind | Ref | Bundle | Text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ticket `<id>` | `status` | `tickets/<id>/fields` | first of its `bundles` | `<id>: type <type>; state <state>; iteration <iteration>; owner <owner>`, then `; parent <parent>` and `; links <type> <target>, <type> <target>` (or `; links none`) when present |
| | `code` | `tickets/<id>/problem` | first of its `bundles` | the `problem` value |
| | `code` | `tickets/<id>/decision` | first of its `bundles` | the `decision` value |
| each commit entry | `code` | `tickets/<id>/commit/<bundle>/<sha>` | that entry's bundle | `<bundle> <sha>: <text>` |
| each verified entry, `<k>` from 1 | `verification` | `tickets/<id>/verified/<k>` | first of its `bundles` | the whole entry |
| decision `D<n>` | `decision` | `decisions/D<n>` | first bundle of its ticket, or `none` | `<decision> \| rationale: <rationale> \| options: <entries joined with "; "> \| decided_by: <decided_by> \| recorded_at: <recorded_at> \| status: <status>` |
| raised ticket `R<n>` | `scope` | `raised/R<n>` | its first bundle, or `none` | `<ticket>: <summary> \| rank <rank>, <in_bundle_confidence>: <reason>` |
| | `status` | `raised/R<n>/fields` | its first bundle, or `none` | `<ticket>: type <type>; state <state>; iteration <iteration>; owner <owner>`, with the same optional `parent` and `links` parts |

`<ticket>` is the ticket id (for a decision, its `ticket` value). `<line>` is the line of the
item's `### ` heading, or of the entry for a commit or verified entry. When `options` is
`none recorded`, the decision text says `options: none recorded`.

`handoff.sh commits <file>` prints `<bundle>`, `<sha>`, `<ticket>`, `<line>` per commit
entry, tab-separated, in file order. Stage 1 uses it to seed the review groups.

# Handoff: deactivate users

## Bundles

- app: repo ./app; pr none; branch feature; base main

## Tickets

### APP-1
- type: Story
- state: Active
- iteration: none
- owner: Developer
- parent: FEAT-1
- bundles: app
- problem: Removing a user deletes the record, so its history is lost.
- decision: Add a deactivate command that keeps the row and sets its status to inactive.
- commits:
  - app 9c5f77c: add the status column migration so every row has a status.
- verified:
  - The test suite runs with one test skipped; check: sh run-tests.sh

## Decisions

### D1
- ticket: APP-1
- decision: Whether a deactivated user can be reactivated is left for later.
- rationale: not recorded
- options: none recorded
- decided_by: not recorded
- recorded_at: not recorded
- status: deferred

## Raised tickets

none
```
