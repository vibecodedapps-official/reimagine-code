# Resume

`/cca:resume <run-id> [--from <stage>] [--live <file>]` reruns an audit from a stage,
reusing only artifacts whose inputs have not changed. It never reuses a stale stage and
never loses a finished one. With `--live`, it first imports approved live check results
(step 4); a result reruns the stages that review it.

## Steps

1. **Find the run.** Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs.json` and take the entry whose
   `run_id` is the invocation's `run-id`. When there is none, or its `path` no longer
   exists, stop with one line saying so. The run directory is that `path`. Append this
   invocation's block to `<run dir>/invocations.md` (SKILL.md, Invocation block). After a
   compaction, read the `--from` and `--live` values from the last block there; a run from
   0.4.0 or earlier has no `invocations.md`, and the block in your context is the only
   copy.
2. **Recover state.** Read, in the run directory, `manifest.json` and `stages.json`
   only. If `manifest.json` is missing, stop with one line saying the run directory is
   unrecoverable. With `--live`, a missing `stages.json`, a stage 1 entry that is missing
   or `running`, or a missing `audit-brief.md` stops resume with one line, before
   anything is installed or changed: `--live answers the findings of a finished run;
   resume without --live first`. Without `--live`, a missing `stages.json` is
   recoverable: the first stage to
   rerun is 1, with empty approvals and no earlier superseded records (nothing
   survives to carry over), and stage 1 writes a new `stages.json` from
   `1-orient.md` D7. Every approval in `stages.json` `approvals` stands: do not ask for
   it again. A stage whose status is `running` counts as incomplete, since its agents
   belonged to an earlier session; it is rerun, and nothing waits for its old agents.
   If the stage 1 entry is missing, is `running`, or `audit-brief.md` does not exist,
   the first stage to rerun is 1: remove any pre-existing `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new`,
   so `1-orient.md` section C never reuses a file this invocation did not write; skip
   steps 3 to 6, then run steps 7 to 10 with stage 1 as the first rerun stage (step 7
   supersedes any stage 1 outputs that exist; step 10 continues with stage 1 as
   `1-orient.md` section D describes for resume, reusing the run directory, run id,
   `runs.json` entry, and approvals). Stage 1 on this path
   rebuilds its inputs from `manifest.json`'s `source` key merged with the prompt
   inputs and flags recorded in it, as step 5 does for hashing, and runs section A
   onward with those; the invocation block's `manifest: none` and `inputs: none` are
   ignored. Only when stage 1 is `complete` and `audit-brief.md` exists, also read
   `audit-brief.md` and `common.md`, and run steps 3 to 6.
3. **Head and base sha check.** Every forge read of this step and step 5 names the host
   stage 1 used (`1-orient.md` step 2), read from the saved forge files: the host of the
   `url` in `forge/<bundle>/pr.json` for the PR reads (`gh pr view` and the review
   threads), and the host of the `url` in `forge/<bundle>/<ticket>.json` for that
   ticket's issue read and parent read. Before the first query, check those files: for
   each `github:` PR bundle, `pr.json`, and for each ticket file the stage 1 entry's
   `forge_hashes` names, `<ticket>.json`. Then resolve the host of each GitHub PR and
   ticket id of the manifest again by `1-orient.md` A3, from the inputs step 5 merges
   (`manifest.json`'s `source` key), and compare it with the host of the `url` in its
   saved file, both normalized as A3 says. A ticket that came only from a PR's
   `closingIssuesReferences` is not compared, since its host comes from `pr.json`. When
   a file is missing, `jq -r .url <file>` fails or prints no URL with a host, A3 stops,
   or a host differs, query nothing: the first stage to rerun is 1, handled as step 2
   handles a missing `audit-brief.md` (remove any pre-existing
   `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new`, skip steps 3 to 6, then run steps 7 to 10), and stage
   1 resolves each host from A3 again. With `--live`, stop instead, with the same line
   as step 2, and change nothing.
   Then, for each bundle, resolve its head and base as stage 1 did and compare each with
   the head and base sha stage 1 recorded in `audit-brief.md`. Resolve every ref through
   the mapping lines in the brief's Read paths (`<ref as given> -> <remote>/...`) before
   `rev-parse`. For a GitHub PR, run the `gh pr view` command of `1-orient.md` step 2
   once, with that host, and with its output redirected to `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new`;
   when `gh` exits non-zero or the file is empty, stop resume with one line (the forge
   cannot be queried), never treating it as a changed head. Read `headRefOid` from that
   file with `jq`; step 5 projects the same file, with no second query. Its base is the
   sha the local remote-tracking ref `<remote>/<baseRefName>` resolves to (`<remote>`
   selected as `1-orient.md` A5 does for a PR bundle, from the `url` in `pr.json.new`);
   the PR's `baseRefOid` is not compared, since it is GitHub's cached value. For any
   other bundle, the shas its `branch` and `base` refs resolve to. A bundle with
   `head: working-tree` has no ref for its head, so its head is rebuilt, and the sha
   printed is the current head: first run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh check <repo>`, which
   writes nothing and runs no filter, hook, or program, so a refusal (exit 1) or exit 2
   stops resume with its lines before the snapshot's `git status` could run a filter;
   then create `<run dir>/tmp/` and run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/readonly.sh snapshot <repo> <run dir> <run dir>/tmp/wt-<name>`,
   then `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh build <repo>` as
   `1-orient.md` step 1c does, keeping its `flagged` lines for step 6, then
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/readonly.sh check <repo> <run dir> <run dir>/tmp/wt-<name> <run dir>/tmp/wt-<name> <run dir>/tmp/wt-<name>-check`
   (resolved absolute script paths). A `blocked` line (exit 1) or exit 2 from the check
   stops resume, so the build cannot leave a change that the baseline of step 8 would
   absorb. A refusal from the build (exit 1, for example a merge now in progress) or
   exit 2 stops resume with the script's lines. An unchanged working tree and `HEAD`
   give the recorded sha and rewrite any pruned objects before an agent launches. Then:
   - A changed head: stop and ask whether to restart from stage 1, showing each
     bundle's recorded and current shas. On yes, the first stage to rerun is 1: skip
     steps 4 to 6 and go to step 7. On no,
     stop and change nothing. With `--live`, stop without asking, with one line, and
     change nothing: `--live answers the findings of a finished run; the head or base
     changed, resume without --live first`.
   - A changed base sha is handled like a changed head: stop and ask whether to
     restart from stage 1, showing the recorded and current shas. The brief's list of
     base commits since the merge base and its set of files changed on both sides
     depend on the base tip, not only on the merge base, so an unchanged merge base
     does not make them current. A base sha not present locally (resume does not
     fetch) asks the same way.
   On a stop, remove every `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new`. When stage 1 reruns, it keeps
   these files and reuses them (`1-orient.md` section C); otherwise step 6 removes
   them.
4. **Live results.** The scripts are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/`
   (run each as `sh <resolved absolute script path> ...`), and the formats, modes, and
   messages are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/live.md`. Skip this step when
   step 2 or step 3 sent the run to stage 1, or when there is no `--live` and no
   `<run dir>/live/`. Eligibility comes first, so nothing is installed for a resume that
   cannot use it:
   1. **Eligibility.** With `--live`, step 2 stopped a run whose `stages.json`, stage 1
      entry, or `audit-brief.md` is missing, and step 3 stops a run whose saved forge
      files give no host or another host, or whose head or base changed, each without
      asking.
   2. **Preliminary rerun stage.** Compute the first rerun stage by the rules of steps 5
      and 6, as if no live file existed (the live inputs of stages 6 to 8 are left out of
      the comparison), without removing any file, printing, or stopping. It may be none.
      With `--live` only: without `<run dir>/report.md`, or when that stage is before 6,
      stop with the same line as step 2, since the file answers the findings of a
      finished run and the rerun would replace what it answers.
   3. **Import.** With `--live`, run
      `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/live.sh import <file> <run dir>/report.md <run dir>`
      (the file as an absolute path). It validates the copy it keeps, never the original,
      so the bytes validated are the bytes kept. On exit 1 or 2, stop with the script's
      lines; nothing has been recorded or superseded.
   4. **Reconcile**, on every resume, with or without `--live`, when `<run dir>/live/`
      exists and the preliminary rerun stage (4.2) is none or 6 or later. When it is 5 or
      earlier nothing is reconciled: step 7 retires the imports instead. Steps 5 and 6
      then recompute the hashes and pick the actual first rerun stage after reconciling,
      so a result committed before an interruption is reconciled before the "run is
      current" exit, and a changed derived file is seen. Reconciling, as `live.md`
      ("Reconciling") defines it:
      1. run `live.sh active <run dir>`;
      2. record each `approve` line in `stages.json` `approvals`: kind `live`, target the
         id, decision `approved`, time `approved_at`, plus `by` and `source` (write
         `stages.json` through a temporary file and `mv -f`, as the preamble says). The
         script lists only sources not yet recorded, so a repeat records nothing;
      3. run `live.sh carry <run dir> <id>` for each `carry` line;
      4. remove `<run dir>/tmp/live-entries/` if present, then for each `new` or
         `changed` winner derive its entry (`live.md`, "Derivation") from the winning
         result (for a `result_file` entry, its copy under `live/results-<k>/`, read in
         full) and write it to a file there; a `kept` winner gets none;
      5. run `live.sh assemble <run dir> <run dir>/tmp/live-entries`.
      Any nonzero exit stops resume with the script's lines, before anything is
      superseded or rerun. The orchestrator runs no query itself.
5. **Recompute input hashes.** For each stage entry, recompute every input it records,
   the same way it was recorded:
   - stage 1: the manifest (the file named in `manifest.json`'s `source` key, merged
     again with the recorded prompt inputs and flags and normalized, then compared with
     `manifest.json`), each claims file, the questions file, the content hash of
     every `file:` ticket or PR export, and `plugin_version`;
   - the stage 1 `forge_hashes`: recompute each path in the map (`1-orient.md` step 2:
     `pr.hash.json`, `pr-threads.json`, `<ticket>.json`, `<ticket>.parent.json`) and
     compare it with the recorded hash. For `pr.hash.json`, project the one file step
     3 already fetched with the identical `jq` command of step 2, reading
     `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new`, and hash the result, with no second query:
     `jq '<filter>' forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new | git hash-object --no-filters --stdin`.
     The projection leaves out `headRefOid` and `baseRefOid`, which step 3 compares on
     their own. For `pr-threads.json`, each `<ticket>.json`, and each
     `<ticket>.parent.json`, run the identical `gh` command of step 2, with the same
     host, owner, repo, number, and projection (the host as step 3 reads it: from
     `pr.json` for `pr-threads.json`, and from `<ticket>.json` for that ticket's two
     files), and with its `> <path>` redirect replaced by
     `| git hash-object --no-filters --stdin`, so no file is written. Run every such
     pipeline with `set -o pipefail` in front of it (or write the producer's output to a
     temporary file and hash it only when the producer exited 0): a failed `gh` or `jq`
     would otherwise hash an empty input and read as changed evidence. A producer
     failure stops resume with one line, since the brief's evidence cannot be confirmed
     current; it is never treated as a difference. A difference invalidates stage 1.
     So does a stage 1 entry of a run with any `github:` PR or ticket that has no
     `forge_hashes` map (a run recorded before the map existed). Keep each
     `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new` until step 6 picks the first stage to rerun; step 6
     removes them unless that stage is 1 (then stage 1 renames them, `1-orient.md`
     section C), and any stop removes them;
   - the stage 1 `forge_gaps`: for each path in the map, run the `gh` command of
     `1-orient.md` step 2 that would have written it (the ticket read for
     `<ticket>.json`, the parent read for `<ticket>.parent.json`), with the host,
     owner, repo, and number of the ticket URL the map gives, and its output discarded.
     Exit 0 means the evidence can now be read, which invalidates stage 1, so the rerun
     reads it. A non-zero exit leaves the gap as it was: it is neither a difference nor
     a stop, since the read can keep failing for a reason that does not change, such as
     a GitHub Enterprise Server with no `parent` field. An entry with no `forge_gaps`
     key has no gaps;
   - the pinned sha of every reference and source of truth, by resolving each again as
     stage 1 did, through the brief's ref mapping lines (step 3); a changed one
     invalidates stage 1 (the bundles' head and base shas were already compared in
     step 3, which stops on any change);
   - upstream stage outputs, by `git hash-object --no-filters <file>`;
   - `plugin_version`, which for this release is `0.9.1`.
   - the live inputs of stages 6 to 8: `live/findings.md`, `live/claims.md`, and each
     `live/carried/<id>.md` that `live/findings.md` names, by `git hash-object
     --no-filters <file>` (`live.md`).
   A stage's inputs have changed when any recomputed value differs from the recorded
   one, or when an input is missing. An input a stage recorded as `absent` is the one
   exception: it is unchanged while it stays absent, and absent to present, or present
   to absent, is a change. This amends "an input is missing" for the live files only,
   and the eligibility check of step 4.2 uses it, so a claim-only result (no
   `live/findings.md`) reruns from stage 7, and a finding result from stage 6.
6. **Pick the first stage to rerun.** It is the earliest of:
   - the `--from` stage, when given;
   - the first stage, in the order 1 to 8, whose entry is missing, or whose status is
     anything other than `complete` or `not_applicable` (such as `running`, `failed`,
     or `superseded`), or that is `complete` but lists an output that does not exist;
   - stage 5, when its entry is `complete` but its outputs do not include
     `ledger/inventory.txt` (a run from 0.4.0 or earlier): it is not reusable and the run
     reruns from stage 5, since `ledger.sh` needs the inventory;
   - the first stage whose input hashes changed;
   - stage 1, when any tree `audit-brief.md` maps as `direct` fails a direct-read
     condition now: `git -C <repo> rev-parse HEAD` is not the pinned sha,
     `git -C <repo> --no-optional-locks status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` is not
     empty, or `git -C <repo> ls-files -v` shows a path flagged `S`, `h`, or `s`. For a
     tree the brief maps as `direct (working tree)`, the condition is instead that
     `git -C <repo> rev-parse HEAD` is the recorded `head_parent` and step 3's rebuild
     printed no `flagged` line, so a path flagged since, in a checked-out submodule too,
     reruns stage 1. Rerunning stage 1 re-exports it;
   - stage 1, for a `head: working-tree` bundle in any mode, `export` included, when the
     `flagged` lines of step 3's rebuild differ from the paths the brief lists as flagged
     at audit time, so the brief, Coverage, and the check labels never miss one.
   A `not_applicable` stage whose inputs have not changed is reused. When the first
   stage to rerun is not 1, or nothing needs a rerun, remove every
   `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new` now. When nothing needs a rerun and no `--from` was
   given, say the run is current, print its report path and terminal state, and stop.
7. **Supersede.** Every stage from the first rerun stage through stage 8 is rerun.
   First, compute `<k>` once, before anything is moved: one more than the highest number
   already under `superseded/` (1 when there is none). Every `<k>` in this step and in
   step 8 is this one. Then retire the live results. Whenever the first rerun stage is
   5 or earlier, by any path (step 2's stage 1 path, a restart after step 3, `--from`,
   or the first incomplete or changed stage), and `<run dir>/live/` exists, run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/live.sh retire <run dir> <run dir>/superseded/<k>/live "stage <n> rerun"`
   before anything else here, with `<n>` the first rerun stage. The rerun replaces the
   findings and claims the results answered, and may regenerate the carried ids, so the
   imports are retired and the derived files and `live/carried/` move under
   `superseded/`; the results files stay, so every approval's source still resolves. A
   nonzero exit stops resume before anything is superseded, with the script's lines.
   The walk for a missing `stages.json` below does the same. Then, for each of those
   stages that has an entry, in order:
   1. Move each of its outputs that exists to `superseded/<k>/<path>`, keeping the
      run-relative path (so `ledger/5.md` goes to `superseded/<k>/ledger/5.md`).
      Stage 5's outputs include `ledger/5.md`, stage 6's `ledger/6.md`, and stage 7's
      `ledger/7.md`, each with its stage. Never move `manifest.json`, though stage 1
      lists it as an output: the rerun stage 1 reads its `source` key, as the walk
      path below does.
   2. Rewrite its entry with status `superseded` and, in its `superseded` list, one
      record per moved output: `path`, `moved_to`, and `time`.
   The files `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new` that step 3 wrote are never moved; stage 1
   renames them (`1-orient.md` section C).
   When the first rerun stage is 1 and its entry is missing or `running`, supersede
   the stage 1 outputs that exist (those `1-orient.md` step 10.6 lists) the same way.
   When `stages.json` is missing, no entry lists outputs, so walk the run directory
   instead: move every one of these paths that exists to `superseded/<k>/<path>`:
   `audit-brief.md`, `common.md`, `claims.md`, `groups.md`, `diffs/`, `forge/`,
   `trees/`, `revert/`, `guidelines/`, `domain/`, `scope/`, `pass1/`, `pass2/`, `ledger/`,
   `codex/`, `late/`, `converged/`, `converged.md`, `gate.md`, `report.md`,
   `claims-verdicts.md`, `work-items.jsonl`, `usage.md`, `tmp/`, and `baseline/`.
   `manifest.json`, `stages.json`, and `superseded/` are never moved.
   With no entry to rewrite, keep the move records (`path`, `moved_to`, `time`) and put
   them in the `superseded` list of the new stage 1 entry when stage 1 writes it
   (`1-orient.md` section D, step D7).
   Stages before the first rerun stage keep their entries and outputs unchanged and
   are reused as they are.
8. **Baseline.** When the first rerun stage is 1, stage 1 takes the baseline again.
   Otherwise, retake it now, before any agent launches, as in stage 1 step 1b: move
   the old `baseline/` files, except the stage check files of reused stages, to
   `superseded/<k>/baseline/` (the `<k>` of step 7), and take the snapshot again for
   each audited repo with
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/readonly.sh snapshot <repo> <run dir> <run dir>/baseline/<name>`
   (resolved absolute script path), which writes each repo's new
   `baseline/<name>.marker` and snapshot files. The ignored base for the next check
   restarts at the new baseline (SKILL.md, Read-only check). A fetch runs only when
   stage 1 reruns. A recorded approval covers only the commands in its `commands`
   list: when the planned commands for a repo and remote are all in one recorded list
   for that target, they are not asked again; otherwise ask once, listing the new
   commands, and record a new approval entry.
9. **Mark the run running.** Set the run's `state` in `runs.json` to `running` under
   the lock per SKILL.md, State files. On refusal or failure, continue per that
   section, recording any limitation in `usage.md` and in the first rerun stage's
   final `stages.json` entry, the one it writes when it ends. A resumed run has no
   budget; the original invocation's budget does not carry over.
10. **Continue.** Go to the SKILL.md section for the first rerun stage and run every
   stage after it, with the same rules as an audit. When the first rerun stage is 2, 3,
   or 4, launch every stage among 2, 3, and 4 that is being rerun together; a reused
   stage 2 or 3 counts as satisfied for the barrier, and its recorded
   `output_hashes` are the final hashes. Rerun stages write new entries, each keeping
   the `superseded` list from step 7. When
   stage 1 reruns, it reuses this run's directory, run id, `runs.json` entry,
   approvals, and superseded records, and only rewrites the stage 1 entry as `running`
   (stage 1, section D).
11. **Report.** Stage 8 writes a new `report.md` with a new revision line. An approval
    given to `/cca:act` against the old revision no longer matches, by design.
