# Stage 6: second opinion (Codex through `ccx:ask`)

The orchestrator's procedure for stage 6. The preamble in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/SKILL.md` and the
run's `common.md` apply throughout. The request's content, order, answer cap, sentinel
form, the follow-up's inline layout, and acknowledgment rule are in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/codex-request.md`; this file says how to build, send,
and handle it.

Stage 6 starts when stage 5 is `complete` or `failed` (every scope has finished pass
two and every map-correction top-up has finished).

Inputs: `ledger/5.md` and the other run-directory inputs `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/codex-request.md`
lists (`audit-brief.md`, `common.md`, `audit-evidence.md`, `claims.md`, the diffs and
stats, the `pass2/` files), and the live inputs: `live/findings.md`, each `live/carried/<id>.md` it names,
and its result copies (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/live.md`, "Derivation"). The
result copies are not hashed, as `live.md` says. Every other input, `ledger/5.md`, each
run-directory file the request lists, and each live input, is recorded in the stage
entry's `inputs` with its hash (the `sentinels` map is not a substitute), or `absent`
when a live input does not exist; absent to present, or present to absent, is a change
that reruns the stage (`resume.md`, step 5). `live/findings.md`
exists only on a run resumed with a live finding result. A `_test.drop_ack` naming
`live/findings.md` applies like any other input.

Outputs: `codex/request.md`, `codex/inputs/*`, `codex/response.md`, `ledger/6.md`,
`ledger/mandatory.txt`, `codex/batch-<k>.txt` for each batch `<k>` of the mandatory set
(step 4.3), `codex/followup.md` when a follow-up is sent (step 8), and, when the
fallback answers several batches, `codex/request-<k>.md` and `codex/response-<k>.md`
for each batch `<k>` it answers, numbered from 2 (step 9).

## Steps

1. **Check the budget** first. If it has expired, stage 6 does not start and gets no
   entry; go to stage 8. Otherwise write the stage 6 entry as `running` with its input
   hashes.

2. **Settle the call parameters** and keep them for the stage entry:
   - model: the `--codex-model` id when one was given. When `codex-model` is `default`,
     resolve it by the run's tier: low `gpt-6-luna`, medium and high `gpt-6.1-sol`.
     Always the full id. The resolved id is what `codex_model` records, so a resumed
     run sees the id and not `default`.
   - timeout in seconds: `--codex-timeout` when given (the command already rejected
     values outside 1 to 3,600), else by tier: low `1200`, medium `2400`, high `3600`.
     In a headless session, or when unsure whether a user can answer (the judgment
     of SKILL.md, State files, for a stale lock), at most `540`: a larger value is
     replaced by `540`, so the bridge call ends before the Bash tool's 10-minute
     foreground limit and never moves to the background. In an interactive session
     the value stands. This value is `<timeout>` in the steps below, including the
     reason in step 7, and is what `codex_timeout` records.

3. **Decide who fills the role.**
   - With `--no-codex`, the fallback fills it from the start, with the swap reason
     "--no-codex": build the request (step 4), then go to step 11.
   - Otherwise check availability. Run `codex --version`; if it does not exit 0, swap
     to the fallback with the reason "codex --version failed". Run
     `claude plugin list --json` with Bash and take the `version` of the entry whose id
     starts with `ccx@`; it must be 0.6.0 or later, the first version that saves each
     answer to a file, which step 9 copies instead of retyping it. If the command fails, the
     entry is absent, or the version cannot be read, swap to the fallback with the
     reason "ccx not installed or version unreadable"; if it is older than 0.6.0,
     swap with the reason "ccx <version> is older than 0.6.0". On any swap here,
     build the request (step 4), then go to step 11. Record both versions in the stage
     entry. The orchestrator never runs the `codex` CLI for anything else.

4. **Build the request** from `ledger/5.md`, per `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/codex-request.md`:
   1. Copy each input the template lists to `codex/inputs/<run-relative path>`, with the
      sentinel line the template gives as its first line and a new random token per copy;
      this includes `live/findings.md`, each `live/carried/<id>.md` it names, and its
      result copies, when they exist, so each is a request input with a sentinel. Only generated run-directory
      files get a sentinel; the originals are not changed. Audited source files never get
      a sentinel, are never copied, and are named by their read path and sha from the
      brief. Keep every path and token for the stage entry's `sentinels` map.
   2. Write `codex/request.md`, filling the template: the inputs, then the acknowledgment
      section, then the asks in the template's order (every blocker, high, and medium finding,
      every pass-two downgrade or drop, dropped findings to restore including dismissed
      ones, up to ten new findings, severity recalibration, a non-binding merge verdict
      per bundle), within the 3,000-word answer cap and two quoted lines per citation. Ask 1
      also covers each finding `live/findings.md` lists, judged with its live result, and
      names each carried one with its carried file. When `live/carried/` holds an `X<n>`,
      ask 4 numbers the additions after the highest carried `X<n>`: the carried ids are
      reserved, so an addition never reuses one. Asks 1 and 2 each end with the template's
      id slot: when step 4.3 splits the mandatory set, the line
      `for these ids: IDS-BATCH-1` (the first batch here; step 4.3 replaces the
      placeholder by shell); otherwise `for every such finding`. It names each input copy by its absolute path, and each
      audited source by its absolute read path and sha from the brief.
   3. **Mandatory id set and batches.** Never take the id list into the conversation.
      Run `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/ledger.sh mandatory <run dir> >
      <run dir>/tmp/mandatory.txt` and, only on exit 0, `mv -f <run dir>/tmp/mandatory.txt
      <run dir>/ledger/mandatory.txt`. Its content, one id per line, sorted and unique,
      is the mandatory set: every `ledger/5.md` finding id whose state after pass two is
      blocker, high, or medium, every id that pass two downgraded or dropped, and every id
      `live/findings.md` lists (a carried id may have no section in `ledger/5.md`). It is
      one deduplicated set for the request, the follow-up, the fallback batches, and the
      completion check (step 10). An id that asks 1 and 2 both apply to (a downgrade of a
      high, say) gets one position, not two. Asks 1 and 2 require a position for each, and
      no mandatory id may be left unrequested in a run that completes. A nonzero exit
      fails stage 6 (the run will end `partial`). Count it with `wc -l`. The 3,000-word
      answer cap cannot hold more than 60 ids, so when the set has more, split it in id
      order by shell into batch files `<run dir>/codex/batch-<k>.txt` of at most 60 ids,
      numbered from 1, for example `awk 'NR % 60 == 1 { k++ } { print >
      ("<run dir>/codex/batch-" k ".txt") }' <run dir>/ledger/mandatory.txt`; each batch
      is the id list in the slot of asks 1 and 2. A request holds a placeholder line `for
      these ids: IDS-BATCH-<k>` per slot, which shell replaces in place with the batch's
      ids, never by typing ids and never by appending at the end of the file, for example
      with `ids=$(paste -sd, <run dir>/codex/batch-1.txt | sed 's/,/, /g')`, then `awk -v
      p=IDS-BATCH-1 -v ids="$ids" '{ i = index($0, p); if (i) { n++; $0 = substr($0, 1,
      i - 1) ids substr($0, i + length(p)) } print } END { exit (n == 0 || ids !~
      /[^ ]/) }' <run dir>/codex/request.md > <run dir>/tmp/request.new && mv -f
      <run dir>/tmp/request.new <run dir>/codex/request.md`. The offset comes from the
      placeholder itself (`length(p)`), so any `<k>` works. Request files for batch `<k>`
      from 2 use `-v p=IDS-BATCH-<k>` and the same replacement, on
      `<run dir>/codex/request-<k>.md`. The `END` clause checks only the lines that held
      the placeholder, not any other text in the file: it exits 1, so that `mv` does not
      run and stage 6 fails, when no line held the placeholder or the ids are empty or
      only spaces, which would leave a slot ending in `for these ids:`.
      - Codex: `codex/request.md` carries the first batch and the one follow-up (step
        8) carries at most 60 positions in total: the first batch's ids still without a
        position come first, then the second batch's ids in order until 60 is reached.
        Every mandatory id that neither carries (the rest of the second batch, and
        any further batch) goes to the fallback (step 11), in batches of at
        most 60, one `cca:adversary` launch per batch with scope `second-opinion-<k>`,
        each with its own `codex/request-<k>.md` (built as in the next bullet),
        launched in step 8 once the follow-up is composed and before the follow-up call
        is made (step 9 gives the numbering). It is recorded as a
        partial swap: role second opinion, scope those batches, from Codex `<model>` to
        `cca:adversary`, reason "mandatory ids beyond the Codex request and follow-up".
        These batches fail stage 6 only when one of them fails after the ladder (step
        11).
      - Fallback (step 11): `cca:adversary` is launched once per batch, each launch
        with its own request, `codex/request.md` for the first batch and
        `codex/request-<k>.md` for batch `<k>` from 2, written at step 11. Each has
        the same content except its batch's ids in the slot and, for `<k>` from 2,
        only asks 1 and 2 (asks 3 to 6 and the merge verdicts are answered in the
        first request).
      - `batched` is true in the stage entry when more than one batch was requested
        (a Codex follow-up carried the second, or the fallback was launched for a
        further batch), else false.

5. **Check the session's repository.** ccx runs Codex from the top of the git
   repository that contains the session's directory, and the orchestrator cannot move
   it. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in the session's directory. If the session's
   directory is not in a git repository, send the request anyway; ccx refuses,
   and step 7 swaps. The request has one form, so the run directory's location and the
   request's size change nothing here: Codex reads the inputs and sources by the
   absolute paths the request names.

6. **Call Codex** with the Skill tool, skill `ccx:ask`, options first:

   ```
   --model <model> --timeout <timeout> Read "<absolute path of codex/request.md>" and answer as it asks.
   ```

   Record the model and timeout passed for this call. In an interactive session the
   call can take longer than a foreground command allows and move to the background.
   The fallback batches for ids neither the request nor the follow-up carries (step
   4.3) are launched before the follow-up call (step 8); once a call is made in an
   interactive session, wait for its completion notification without polling or any
   other tool call. In a headless session (or when unsure whether a user can answer,
   as in step 2), never end the turn while a background call is live, as in stage 1
   step 6b, since the turn's end ends the session; with the cap of step 2, such a run
   never has one.

7. **Parse the result.** ccx ends its output with a line `status: <value>`, where
   the value is `ok`, `failed`, `refused`, or `timeout`, and prints a line
   `thread <id>` when a thread started. Take the last `status:` line and the `thread`
   line. A run that reached Codex also prints `output: <path>` as the line immediately
   before the final `status:` line: the saved copy of the answer, which step 9 copies.
   Take only that line, never an `output:` line elsewhere in the answer. A refused call
   saves nothing, so check the line only when the status is `ok`: if it is missing
   there, or the line there is `ccx: warning: could not save the output`, treat the
   call as failed and swap to the fallback with the reason "ccx saved no output file",
   with no retry. Otherwise:

   | Status | Handling |
   |---|---|
   | `ok` | continue to step 8 |
   | `failed`, or no status line | retry once as a fresh call with the same arguments; on a second `failed` or missing status, swap to the fallback with the reason "codex failed twice" |
   | `refused` | do not retry; swap to the fallback, recording ccx's message as the reason |
   | `timeout` | swap to the fallback with the reason "codex timeout after <timeout> s" |

   A fresh retry is not a follow-up.

8. **Check acknowledgments.** Every input the request names must have its sentinel quoted
   in the answer. When `_test.drop_ack` names an input (by run-directory path, such as
   `ledger/5.md` or `live/findings.md`), treat that input's acknowledgment as missing for
   the first `times` checks, whatever the answer says. Also compute now, against the
   answer, the mandatory ids (step 4.3) that it leaves without a position, and whether a
   second batch of asks 1 and 2 is due. For Codex's answer, first save it verbatim in
   `codex/response.md` (step 9), since the missing ids are read from that file; a
   follow-up's output is appended to it later and never overwrites it. A fallback batch
   (step 11) saves nothing here: it already wrote its own `codex/response.md` or
   `codex/response-<k>.md`, which this check reads, and the batches are appended to
   `codex/response.md` only as step 11 says. Then compute the missing ids with
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/ledger.sh missing <run dir> >
   <run dir>/tmp/missing.txt`: it prints the mandatory ids with no provenance line in
   `codex/response*.md`, by the rules `check` uses. A nonzero exit fails stage 6. Count
   with `wc -l` and never read the list into the conversation; build the follow-up's id
   slots from that file by shell.
   - All inputs acknowledged, no mandatory id without a position, and no second batch
     due: continue to step 9.
   - Anything else (an input unacknowledged, a mandatory id without a position, or a
     second batch due): access or coverage is not confirmed. Send the one follow-up
     allowed, built as a file, so that shell, not the model, writes the ids. Write
     `<run dir>/codex/followup.md` with: the unacknowledged inputs, when there are any,
     in inline form (full content under their path and sentinel headers) with a request
     to acknowledge them and revise any answer that depended on them; and, when some id
     needs asking, asks 1 and 2 for at most 60 ids in total, each ending with a
     placeholder line `for these ids: IDS-FOLLOWUP`, which shell replaces in place (the
     awk of step 4.3 with `-v p=IDS-FOLLOWUP`, on `<run dir>/codex/followup.md`) with the
     ids built by shell
     from `<run dir>/tmp/missing.txt` and the batch files: the first batch's ids still
     without a position, then the second batch's ids in order as far as 60 allows
     (`batched` is then true). When no id needs asking (only inputs are unacknowledged),
     leave asks 1 and 2 out of the file, placeholder lines and all, so that no slot is
     written empty. A nonzero exit of that awk fails stage 6. Second-batch ids that do
     not fit are not asked here; step 4.3 sends
     them to the fallback: launch those fallback batches now, before this follow-up
     call (step 11, numbered as step 9 says), so they run while Codex answers and a
     budget that expires during the call still lets them finish. Measure
     `codex/followup.md` in bytes (`wc -c`). The cap is 450,000 bytes, or
     `_test.inline_cap_bytes` when set. Over the cap, the follow-up is not sent and
     stage 6 fails as below; no diff is dropped. Then call the Skill tool,
     `ccx:ask`, in one of two forms, with the options `--model <model> --timeout
     <timeout> --resume <thread id>` first:
     - Every input was acknowledged (only positions are missing or a second batch is
       due): Codex has shown that it reads the run directory, so the call is by path,
       `Read "<absolute path of codex/followup.md>" and answer as it asks.`
     - Any input was unacknowledged: Codex may not be able to open run-directory files,
       so it could not open the follow-up either. Read `codex/followup.md` with the Read
       tool in full, with no offset or limit (read the rest if the read is cut short),
       and pass its text verbatim as the call's text, in place of the `Read` sentence.
       This is model-mediated: the ids are written into the file by shell, but the model
       carries the text into the call, which is the one exception to writing no id into
       a tool argument. The sentinel check and `ledger.sh missing` run on the answer as
       usual; they do not prove the text arrived unchanged, since sentinels check
       headers and `missing` checks id-colon lines, not bodies.

     With no thread id, send it as a fresh call in the same form, and the file then also
     names `common.md`, `audit-evidence.md`, `audit-brief.md`, and `ledger/5.md` by their
     absolute paths under `codex/inputs/`, not the whole request again. Handle its status as in step 7,
     except that a swap is replaced by stage 6 failing, since the first answer already
     exists.
   - Still unacknowledged after the follow-up: stage 6 fails. Keep the answer, list the
     unacknowledged inputs in `ledger/6.md` and the stage entry, naming as one possible
     cause that the inline text in `codex/followup.md` was misread, or
     that Codex could not open a path, and mark in `ledger/6.md` that no finding passes
     the review gate on stage 6's account. The run will end `partial`.

   There is at most one follow-up per run of stage 6. A mandatory position the request
   or the follow-up asked for and still missing after the follow-up is handled in step
   10. Ids neither carried are not part of the follow-up: step 11 launches them.

9. **Save the answer verbatim** in `codex/response.md`: the file ccx saved, copied
   unchanged at step 8 before the missing ids are computed, and never retyped. With
   one shell command and absolute paths, run `cp -- "<src>" "<run dir>/codex/response.md"`,
   where `<src>` is the path of the `output:` line of step 7. For a follow-up, run
   `printf '%s\n' '--- follow-up, thread <id> ---' >> "<run dir>/codex/response.md"` and
   then `cat -- "<src>" >> "<run dir>/codex/response.md"`, with the follow-up's own
   path. Only after the command exits 0, run `rm -f -- "<src>"`. On a failed copy, keep
   the source and stop stage 6 as a write failure. The fallback batches of step 4.3 are known once
   step 8 has composed the follow-up, so launch them then, before the follow-up call
   (they are Agent launches, not Codex calls), and wait for them before step 10.
   Number them `<k>` from 2 upward in id order over the ids neither the request nor
   the follow-up carried, re-batched in at most 60; when the fallback fills the role,
   `<k>` is the batch number of the original split. That `<k>` names the request and
   response files, the agent scope `second-opinion-<k>`, and the `--- batch <k> ---`
   line.

10. **Check the mandatory positions, then write `ledger/6.md` once.** Before writing,
    take the ids step 10 requires, which are every mandatory id from step 4.3 (computed
    from `ledger/5.md` and `live/findings.md`; all of them are requested across the
    batches), and compare
    them with the finding ids the answer, with any follow-up appended, addresses with a
    position, by the same `ledger.sh missing` output to `tmp/missing.txt` (a nonzero
    exit fails stage 6; the list is counted with `wc -l`, never read). When an id has a position in more than one place, the later one replaces
    the earlier; both stay in `codex/response.md`. For Codex this is a check after the
    fact: the follow-up for missing positions was already sent in step 8, and step 10
    sends none. A mandatory id the request or the follow-up asked for, still without a
    position in the answer with the follow-up appended, fails stage 6: keep the answer, list the ids in
    `ledger/6.md` and under `missing_positions` in the stage entry, and mark in
    `ledger/6.md` that no finding passes the review gate on stage 6's account. For the
    fallback, whether it fills the role or only the batches Codex did not carry, a mandatory
    id of that launch's batch without a position fails the attempt (the ladder in step
    11). "seen, no position" applies only to ids outside the mandatory set.

    Write the position sections and the other parts first, then append `## Seen, no
    position` with the output of `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/ledger.sh
    seen <run dir> >> <run dir>/ledger/6.md`, redirected and never read (the script reads `ledger/6.md`, so the file must exist first).
    `ledger/6.md` is complete only then and is not rewritten after. Before marking stage
    6 complete, run `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/ledger.sh check <run dir>
    --through 6 --stage6 complete > <run dir>/tmp/check6.txt` and read only `wc -l` of
    that file and its first 50 lines (`head -n 50`). It covers one position per id, each position's
    provenance line in the response files, the mandatory set, the `## Seen, no position`
    list, and the `X<n>` additions. A nonzero exit fails stage 6 like a missing position:
    append its `ledger: ` lines to `ledger/6.md` under `## Stage failure` and list them in
    the stage entry, and mark that no finding passes the review gate on stage 6's account.

    `ledger/6.md` holds, in this order. Each part that is not a finding section sits
    under its own `## ` heading that is not a finding id (the names are in brackets),
    so that a finding section, which runs to the next `## ` heading, never takes it in
    (stage 7 slices the file by those headings):
    - who filled the role: `codex <model>` with the thread id, or `cca:adversary`
      (fallback) with its requested model, and any swap, whole or partial (the batches
      it covers), with its reason (`## Role`);
    - the acknowledgment table: each input, its sentinel, acknowledged or not
      (`## Acknowledgments`);
    - one section per finding id the answer addresses, whether it is in `ledger/5.md`
      or only in `live/findings.md` (a carried `X<n>` or `L<n>` may have a position here
      although its block is no longer in any ledger file):

      ```
      ## <finding id>
      - position: <verdict with its own evidence | position on the pass-two downgrade or drop | restore requested | severity recalibration to <severity>>
      - evidence: <as cited in the answer>
      - answer location: codex/response.md, <heading or line>
      ```

      Each of the three lines is nonempty; one section per id, the later position
      replacing the earlier. The check requires that some `codex/response.md` or
      `codex/response-<k>.md` has a line starting with the id and `:` (after leading
      spaces, `-`, `*`, `#`, and backticks); the answer location is a nonempty pointer for
      readers and is not checked.

    - Codex additions, each in the `common.md` schema (heading `### X<n>: <title>`)
      with `origin: codex` and an id `X<n>`. They are late additions;
    - the non-binding merge verdict per bundle, marked as such; it never replaces the
      report's verdict rules (`## Merge verdict (non-binding)`);
    - every `ledger/5.md` finding id that is not mandatory and has no position section
      above, listed as `- <id>` lines under "seen, no position" (`## Seen, no position`),
      from `ledger.sh seen`. A mandatory id is never listed so: with no position it fails
      the stage, as above;
    - when stage 6 failed, the missing positions or unacknowledged inputs and the mark
      that no finding passes the review gate on its account (`## Stage failure`).

11. **Fallback.** Launch `cca:adversary` with the Agent tool, in the background, never as
    a fork, with `model: fable`, once per batch of step 4.3 that the fallback answers
    (every batch when it fills the role; only the batches of ids that neither the Codex
    request nor its follow-up carried, step 4.3, a partial swap), all together, after first writing
    `codex/request-<k>.md` for each batch `<k>` from 2. Each launch is a separate agent
    in the stage entry, with scope `second-opinion-<k>` for batch `<k>` (scope
    `second-opinion` when it fills the role with one batch). The prompt holds the scratch
    folder `tmp/agents/second-opinion[-<k>]/` and the paths
    of `audit-brief.md`, `common.md`, `audit-evidence.md`, and that batch's request
    (`codex/request.md` or `codex/request-<k>.md`, which the fallback reads by path), with
    the instruction to answer the request as it asks, within its caps, and write the answer
    to `codex/response.md` (batch `<k>` from 2: `codex/response-<k>.md`) ending with
    `status: complete`. Record a swap (role second opinion, from Codex `<model>` to
    `cca:adversary` on `fable`, reason; for the batches Codex did not carry, the partial swap
    of step 4.3 with its scope). Once every batch has succeeded, append each
    `codex/response-<k>.md` to `codex/response.md` (after Codex's answer and follow-up,
    in the partial case) after a line `--- batch <k> ---`. The ladder applies to each
    launch on its own:

    | Failure | Action |
    |---|---|
    | first | relaunch with `model: opus` |
    | second | stage 6 failed |

    The fallback failed when it returned an error or its file does not end with
    `status: complete`. A `_test.fail` entry with `role: fallback` and scope `any` or
    `second-opinion` (or that batch's `second-opinion-<k>`) makes its first `times`
    completions failures. On success, run the step 8 acknowledgment check and the
    step 10 mandatory-position check, for that batch's ids, on the fallback's answer.
    A `not read: <path>` or a missing sentinel quote for any input, or a mandatory id
    of its batch without a position, fails that attempt, so it follows the ladder
    above (relaunch on opus, then stage 6 failed). A batch that fails after the ladder
    fails the stage; the other launches still finish. No follow-up call exists for the
    fallback. When stage 6 fails for this reason, list the unacknowledged inputs in
    `ledger/6.md` and the stage entry as step 8's last bullet says, and the ids without
    a position under `missing_positions`. `batched` is true when more than one batch was
    requested (step 4.3), so every mandatory id is requested.
    When every batch passes both checks, write `ledger/6.md` from the answers as in
    step 10. Its additions also take `origin: codex` and ids `X<n>`, since they come
    from the second opinion, numbered after the highest carried `X<n>` (a carried id is
    reserved); only the first batch's answer carries additions.

12. **Stage completion.** Stage 6 is `complete` when an answer from Codex or the
    fallback is saved, every input is acknowledged by whoever filled the role, every id
    step 10 requires (every mandatory id, step 4.3) has a position, and `ledger/6.md` is
    written and passes `check --through 6 --stage6 complete`; otherwise `failed`, and the run will end `partial`.

13. **Read-only check.** Run the check in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/SKILL.md` and write
    `baseline/6-check.md`. ccx's own request and thread files in its data
    directory are allowed writes.

14. **Write the stage 6 entry last,** once the check has passed, per the preamble, with:
    status, inputs, outputs, agents (the fallback, if any, with tokens labeled "task
    notification, subagent_tokens; scope not documented"), swaps with reasons, and
    these stage 6 keys:

    ```json
    "codex_model": "gpt-6.1-sol",
    "codex_timeout": 1200,
    "sentinels": { "ledger/5.md": "<token>", "live/findings.md": "<token>" },
    "codex": { "called": true, "form": "path", "thread": "<id>", "status": "ok",
               "retried": false, "follow_up": false, "unacknowledged": [],
               "codex_version": "<text>", "ccx_version": "<text>" },
    "missing_positions": [],
    "batched": false
    ```

    `codex_model` and `codex_timeout` are the values passed on every call (the first
    call, a retry, and the follow-up all pass the same ones), or, when no call was made
    (`--no-codex` or Codex unavailable), the values settled in step 2,
    with `"called": false`. In `usage.md`, each Codex call has its wall-clock and tokens
    "not reported".

    `missing_positions` lists the mandatory ids still without a position at stage end:
    those the Codex request or follow-up asked for and left unanswered after the
    follow-up, and those of any fallback batch that failed after the ladder;
    `batched` is true when more than one batch of asks 1 and 2 was requested, by a Codex
    follow-up or by a further fallback launch (one agent per batch, scope
    `second-opinion-<k>`), else false.
    `codex.form` is always `path`.
