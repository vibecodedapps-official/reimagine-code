# Stage 1: orient

The orchestrator runs this stage alone. Sections A to D happen before stage 1 proper: a
stop there ends the command with one message, and nothing is written except as
sections C and D say. Their labels are fixed, but they run in this order: A, B, D1 to
D4 (the run directory exists before any PR is read), C, then D5 to D7. Steps 1 to 10
follow the stage's rule numbers. Order matters: the read-only baseline (step 1b) is
taken right after the approved fetch, before any export or other stage 1 work, so
everything after it is checked. A bundle with `head: working-tree` has its head built in
step 1c, right after the baseline, for the same reason.

## Tool check

Before section A, run `command -v jq`. When it prints nothing, tell the user before the
run starts, in plain words: `jq` is not installed, so the work-items file will not be
checked against the report and a PR cannot be read through `gh`; install it with
`winget install jqlang.jq` on Windows, `brew install jq` on macOS, or the system package
manager on Linux. Then continue; `work-items.sh` reports `work-items: jq not found`
when it runs.

## A. Normalize the inputs

1. Read the manifest, when `manifest` is not `none`. Relative paths in it are relative
   to the manifest's directory. Relative paths in the prompt inputs and flags are
   relative to the session's directory. Under `/cca:resume` with stage 1 as the first
   rerun stage, the invocation block's `manifest: none` and `inputs: none` are ignored:
   rebuild the inputs from the run directory's `manifest.json` `source` key (the
   manifest path, the prompt inputs, and the flags it recorded in A3), and do A2
   onward with those. When the manifest file `source` names no longer exists, stop with
   one line saying so.
2. Merge the prompt inputs into it:
   - A GitHub PR URL or `github:owner/repo#n` naming a PR adds a bundle with that `pr`.
     Its `repo` is the session's repository when that repository has a GitHub remote
     for `owner/repo`, else the manifest bundle with that remote; if neither, stop:
     `no local clone for <id>; add it to the manifest`.
   - An issue URL, `github:owner/repo#n` naming an issue, `#n`, or `file:<path>` adds a
     ticket to the only bundle. With more than one bundle, stop and ask which bundle it
     belongs to.
   - A directory that is a git checkout adds a bundle with that `repo`; it still needs
     a PR or a branch and a base.
   - `--claims` files are added to `claims`. `--questions` replaces `questions`.
     `--models` entries override the manifest's `models` entry for the same role.
   An input that disagrees with a manifest entry for the same bundle (another branch,
   base, or PR) stops the run and shows both.
3. Normalize:
   - Every path to an absolute path. Every repo path must be a git checkout
     (`git -C <path> rev-parse --show-toplevel`); store the top level. For every
     audited repository (bundles, references, and sources of truth), with `<repo>` the
     stored top level, when
     `git -C <repo> config --local --includes --get-regexp '^(remote\..*\.promisor|extensions\.partialclone)$'`
     exits 0 (`--includes` follows the file's `include` directives, which `--local`
     alone skips), stop before stage 1 with one line per such repository,
     `<repo>: partial clones are not supported`: the agents' `git show` and
     `git diff` would fetch missing objects over the network, against the read-only
     boundary.
   - `scratch`: when the manifest has it, an absolute path, relative to the manifest's
     directory like every manifest path. D2 checks it.
   - Bundle names: the repo directory's base name, lowercased, with `-2`, `-3` added
     when two bundles share it. `<bundle>` in file names below is this name.
     References and sources of truth keep their `name`, slugged the same way.
   - Each custom `groups[].name`: slug it as D3 slugs the run id, but with no length
     cap: lowercase, with runs of characters outside `a-z0-9` turned into one `-`.
     Before stage 1, stop with one line `groups: <name> slugs to nothing` when its
     slug is empty; stop with one line `groups: <name> is a reserved scope name` when
     its slug is `tests`, `hygiene`, `tests-hygiene`, `interactions`, `combined`, or
     `unticketed`. When two entries share a slug, stop with one line
     `groups: <a> and <b> share the slug <s>`. When a slug equals `<scope>-topup`
     or `<scope>-maptopup`, where `<scope>` is another entry's slug or a reserved
     scope name, stop with
     one line `groups: <name> collides with the top-up files of <scope>`.
     `cross-cutting` is not reserved: the manifest's `groups` key replaces the merge
     that produces it. Reject these names; never rename them. Each of these stops keeps
     its line and adds one plain sentence on what is wrong and what to change, such as "No
     group name is left after making it file-safe; give the group a name with letters or
     digits."
   - Ticket and PR ids to `github:owner/repo#n` or `file:<absolute path>`. A short id
     such as `#159` is accepted only when the bundle's repo has exactly one GitHub
     remote (`git -C <repo> remote -v`); otherwise stop with
     `<id>: write it as github:owner/repo#n or file:<path>`, and add that an id is
     accepted as `github:owner/repo#n`, `#n` (when the repo has one GitHub remote), or
     `file:<path>`, and that a ticket from another forge goes in through an export file
     (the README's export route).
   - `<host>`: every GitHub PR and ticket id normalized here has a host, which its
     reads in section C and step 2 name. Settle each bundle's PR first, then its
     tickets. The host is the first of:
     1. the host of its URL, when the manifest or a prompt input gave the id as a URL;
     2. otherwise the host of the bundle repo's remote whose fetch URL names that owner
        and repo and gives a host (the `(fetch)` lines of `git -C <repo> remote -v`).
        When such remotes give different hosts, take `origin`'s when `origin` is one of
        them; otherwise stop before stage 1 with
        `<id>: write it as a URL to name its host`;
     3. otherwise, for a ticket, the host of its bundle's GitHub PR, when it has one;
     4. otherwise `github.com`.
     The host of a URL: drop the scheme (`https://`, `http://`, or `ssh://`), then
     everything through the last `@` before the first `/`, then cut at the first `/`;
     the scp form `[user@]host:path`, which has no scheme, is also cut at its `:`. An
     `https://` or `http://` host keeps any `:port`, since gh names such a host with its
     port, and needs no check. An SSH host (`ssh://` or the scp form) drops any `:port`.
     An SSH host of `github.com` or `ssh.github.com` gives `github.com`; any other counts
     only when gh knows it, that is when
     `gh auth status --json hosts --hostname <host> --jq '.hosts | length'` prints a
     number above 0 (run once per distinct host per run; it is not pre-approved, so it
     may prompt). That command exits 0 and lists a known host even when its login has
     failed, so a known host with a broken login is still the host, and its read then
     fails and stops the run below; it never falls through to another host. When it
     prints 0 (gh knows no such host, as for an SSH config alias), that remote gives no
     host. When it exits non-zero or prints anything else (gh older than 2.81.0 has no
     `--json` here), stop before stage 1 with
     `<id>: cannot tell whether gh knows <host>; write the id as a URL or use gh 2.81.0 or later`.
     A local-path remote gives no host: a `file://` URL, a URL
     with no `:` before its first `/`, or one whose part before the first `:` is a
     single letter (a drive, as in `C:/src/app`) or holds `/` or `\`. Resolve each
     repo's remote hosts once per run and reuse them for every id. Every host is
     normalized, here and wherever one is compared (section C, resume step 3):
     lowercased, and without a default `:443` for `https://` or `:80` for `http://`.
     A ticket that comes only from a PR's `closingIssuesReferences` is not known
     here: it takes the host of its `url` when step 2 reads `pr.json`. The host is not
     part of the normalized id, so `manifest.json` and the id formats do not change.
     When stage 1 reruns under `/cca:resume`, section A runs again from `source`, and the
     same rule gives the same host.
   - `ticket_token`: an optional bundle key. A string becomes a one-element list. The
     saved manifest keeps the list; step 8.1 reads it for the bundle's exported tickets.
   - `run_once`: an optional bundle key, with no default. A string becomes a one-element
     list. The saved manifest keeps the list. Each entry is a repo-relative glob pattern
     for run-once artifacts, such as database migrations. Step 3 lists the bundle's
     changed files that match, and the brief carries the list. A.4 validates it.
   - `head`: an optional bundle key, kept in the saved manifest. Its only value is
     `working-tree`, which makes the bundle's head a commit built from the repo's working
     tree (step 1c). It is a manifest key only, with no flag. A.4 validates it.
   - `test_command`, `test_run`, `test_paths`, `test_setup`, `test_timeout`: optional
     bundle keys, kept in the saved manifest, with no default but those below. With
     `test_command`, step 6b runs the bundle's changed test files with the change
     reverted; setting it is the user's consent to run the bundle's own commands.
     `test_command` and `test_setup` are commands for `sh -c`. `test_run` and
     `test_paths` are repo-relative glob patterns, as for `run_once`; a string becomes a
     one-element list. `test_run` names the files to run; `test_paths` names test code,
     and its default is the list in `revert-tests.sh`'s header. `test_timeout` is whole
     seconds per command, default 300. A.4 validates them.
   - `sources_of_truth`: when the manifest lists it, it replaces the default order.
     Otherwise the default order is: legacy source code, then a guidelines corpus
     (each only when supplied, as a reference named `legacy` or a source entry), then
     the audited repos' own docs (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`), then
     ticket text.
   - `questions`: `default` is Q1 to Q4 below. A questions file is a markdown list of
     `id: question` lines; a line `extends: default` keeps the four and adds the
     file's.
     - `Q1` best practice: does the change follow the ranked sources and the repo's
       own conventions?
     - `Q2` semantic drift: does the code do what the ticket and the claims say, no
       more and no less?
     - `Q3` technical debt: what does the change leave for later, and is that
       recorded?
     - `Q4` decision quality: were the choices the change made the right ones, which
       alternatives existed, and which does the auditor recommend, with the reason?
   - `models`: the merged role-to-model map, for roles digester, mapper, auditor,
     adversary, and merger.
   - `_test`: kept as given.
   - `source`: the manifest file's absolute path (or `none`), the prompt inputs, and
     the flags as the invocation block gave them, with relative paths made absolute
     against the session's directory, so resume can merge them again from any
     directory.
4. Every stop line in this step keeps its text and adds one plain sentence on what is
   wrong and what to change, such as "Bundle app has no base; add a base branch to it in
   the manifest." A bundle needs a repo, a PR or a branch or both, and a base. A bundle whose `pr` is
   a `file:` export must also give `branch` and `base`. A bundle with no resolvable
   base is rejected: stop with `bundle <name>: no base`. A bundle whose `ticket_token`
   is not a string or a non-empty array of strings, or has an entry that does not hold
   `{n}` exactly once and at least one other character, is rejected: stop with
   `bundle <name>: ticket_token must hold {n} once`. A bundle whose `run_once` is not a
   non-empty string or a non-empty array of non-empty strings is rejected: stop with
   `bundle <name>: run_once must be a pattern or a list of patterns`. A bundle whose
   `head` is anything but `working-tree` is rejected: stop with
   `bundle <name>: head must be working-tree`. The test keys are checked in this order,
   and the first that fails stops with its line: a bundle with `test_run`, `test_paths`,
   `test_setup`, or `test_timeout` but no `test_command`:
   `bundle <name>: test_run, test_paths, test_setup, and test_timeout need test_command`;
   a `test_command` or `test_setup` that is not a non-empty string, or holds a newline:
   `bundle <name>: <key> must be a one-line command`; a `test_run` or `test_paths` that
   is not a non-empty string or a non-empty array of non-empty strings, or has an entry
   with a newline: `bundle <name>: <key> must be a pattern or a list of patterns`; a
   `test_command` without `test_run`: `bundle <name>: test_command needs test_run`; a
   `test_timeout` that is not a whole number of 1 or more:
   `bundle <name>: test_timeout must be whole seconds, 1 or more`. A
   `working-tree` bundle needs a `branch`, or a PR whose `headRefName` names it, and that
   branch must be checked out: `git -C <repo> rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` (which prints
   `HEAD` for a detached head) equals it. Otherwise stop before stage 1:
   `bundle <name>: head working-tree needs <branch> checked out, found <x>`. With a
   manifest `branch` the check runs here; for a GitHub PR bundle without one it runs in
   section C, step 3, against `headRefName`. Right after that check, for each
   `head: working-tree` bundle, run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh check <repo>` with the
   resolved absolute script path. It runs the refusal checks of step 1c and nothing else:
   it writes nothing and runs no filter, hook, or program. Exit 1 or 2 stops before
   stage 1, showing the script's lines (on stderr). The refusals are thus checked before
   step 1b's baseline, whose `git status` could otherwise run a filter.
5. Select each audited repo's remote once (bundles, references, and sources of truth);
   every `<remote>` below is this one. For every GitHub PR bundle, however it was
   declared, it is the remote whose URL names the PR's owner and repo
   (`git -C <repo> remote -v`, compared with the `url` field in
   `forge/<bundle>/pr.json`); when none matches, `origin` when the repo has it;
   otherwise the repo's only remote. `pr.json` is read in section C, after D4, so for a
   PR bundle this selection is settled at section C, before step 1a. For every other
   repo it is `origin` when the repo has it, else the repo's only remote, selected
   lazily: only when step 1a needs a fetch from that repo. A repo with several remotes,
   none of them matched or named `origin`, stops the run at that point with one line
   naming the repo and its remotes. A repo with no remote has none selected, so it can
   fetch nothing.

## B. Parse exported forge files

For every `file:` ticket or PR, read the file. It is markdown with a frontmatter block,
or JSON.

1. A ticket requires `id`, `url`, `title`, `state`, and `description`, and may have
   `acceptance_criteria`, `fields` (name and value), `links`, and `comments` (author,
   date, text). A PR requires `id`, `url`, `title`, and `body`, and may have `reviews`
   and `threads` (file, line, comments). Every file requires the provenance keys
   `source`, `exported_by`, and `exported_at`.
2. In the markdown form, the text after the frontmatter block, when not empty, is the
   ticket's `description` or the PR's `body` if the frontmatter does not set that key.
3. A missing required key stops the run before stage 1 with exactly
   `export <path>: missing <key>`, naming the first missing key in the order above,
   with the path as the manifest gave it. Check every export before stopping, and show
   one line per missing key.
4. Keep a list of missing optional keys, one line per file and key, for the brief's
   "not in export" section.
5. The manifest's `forge_exports` key records the command and date that produced the
   exports. Never run that command.

A claims file may be a handoff, written in the format of
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/handoff.md`. After the export checks:

6. Run `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh detect <file>` on each
   claims file, with the resolved absolute script path. Exit 0 means the file is a
   handoff: it has a `cca-handoff:` key, whatever its value, so a malformed or newer one
   fails in the next step instead of being read as prose. Exit 1 means a prose claims
   file. Exit 2 stops the run before stage 1, naming the file.
7. For each handoff, run `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh check
   <file>`. On exit 1, stop the run before stage 1 and show the script's lines, one per
   error, as for export errors. Check every handoff before stopping. Exit 2 stops the
   run too, naming the file.
8. Map each handoff to the manifest. A handoff bundle maps to a manifest bundle when its
   `repo`, resolved against the handoff's directory, has the same top level, else when
   the names are equal. A handoff ticket id maps to a manifest ticket when it equals the
   normalized id, the export's `id`, or, for GitHub, the issue number in the bundle's
   repo. A handoff claim that names a mapped bundle or ticket takes the manifest's name
   in `claims.md` (Steps, step 7). An unmapped bundle or ticket is listed in the
   brief's Handoff section, and its claims keep the handoff's names.

## C. Resolve PRs and check for disagreement

1. For a `github:` PR, read it once: create `forge/<bundle>/` in the run directory
   (D4 made it) and run the `gh pr view` command of step 2, whose output the shell
   redirects to `forge/<bundle>/pr.json`. The output never passes through the model:
   a tool result cannot carry a large output, and the Write tool would re-serialize
   it. Under `/cca:resume`, when `forge/<bundle>/pr.json.new` exists (resume step 3
   wrote it with the same command) and its `url` field names this bundle's host (A3,
   both normalized), owner, repo, and PR number, rename it to
   `forge/<bundle>/pr.json` and query nothing; when the `url` differs (the manifest
   changed the bundle's PR or its host), remove the file and query as on a new run.
   Read every PR field below from that file with `jq`, for example
   `jq -r .headRefOid forge/<bundle>/pr.json`. When `gh` is missing or not
   authenticated, or `jq` is missing, stop and say the PR needs `gh` and `jq`, or an
   exported file. When the read fails, stop with one line that names the host it
   queried and says to give the PR id as a URL when that host is wrong. A stop anywhere
   in this section removes what it wrote: on a new run, the run directory (it holds
   only `forge/` files at that point, and `runs.json` is written at D6, after this
   section); under `/cca:resume`, the `forge/<bundle>/pr.json` files this section wrote
   or renamed.
2. When the manifest gives a `branch` that is not the PR's `headRefName`, or a `base`
   that is not the PR's `baseRefName` (`<remote>/<name>` and `<name>` are equal), stop
   before stage 1 and show both values.
3. The bundle's head is the PR's `headRefOid` for a GitHub PR, else the sha the
   `branch` resolves to. For a GitHub PR, settle A5 here, from `url` in `pr.json`
   (a repo with no remote stops the run: `bundle <name>: no remote`). Its base ref is
   `<remote>/<baseRefName>` for a GitHub PR, else the `base` ref. Its base sha, the
   pinned base, is the sha that ref resolves to locally after step 1a (and its fetch,
   when one was approved); step 3 resolves it. The PR's `baseRefOid` is GitHub's cached
   base at the PR's last sync, not the live branch tip, so it is never the pinned
   base; the brief records it for information only, as the base as GitHub last
   evaluated it. For a bundle with `head: working-tree`, the head is instead the commit
   step 1c builds, and step 1a fetches no head for it. For a GitHub PR, `headRefOid` is
   recorded for information only, and the brief says so when it differs from the local
   `HEAD`. The checked-out branch check of A.4 runs here for a bundle that has no
   manifest `branch`, against `headRefName`, and then so does the `working-tree.sh check`
   of A.4, still before step 1b.

## D. Run directory, run id, and state files

D1 to D4 run after section B and before section C; D5 to D7 run after section C.
Under `/cca:resume` (first rerun stage 1), skip D1 to D4 and D6: reuse the existing
run directory, run id, and `runs.json` entry. Do D5, since `manifest.json` is a
stage 1 output. In D7, keep `approvals` and every stage's `superseded` records
(including the move records resume made for stage 1 outputs when the stage 1 entry was
missing), and only rewrite the stage 1 entry as `running` with its inputs.

1. The **primary repo** is the session's repository if it is one of the bundles,
   otherwise the first bundle.
2. `<scratch>` is the first match of:
   1. the manifest's `scratch` key, when it has one: the path must lie inside the primary
      repo's top level and `git -C <primary> check-ignore -q <scratch>/` must succeed;
      then `<scratch>` is that path, created with `mkdir -p` when missing. Otherwise stop
      before stage 1 with `scratch <path>: not an ignored path inside <primary repo>`.
      With the key present, rules 2 to 4 are not tried. Under `/cca:resume`, the run
      keeps its recorded directory even when `scratch` changed;
   2. `scratch/`, `tmp/`, or `.scratch/` in the primary repo, when the directory exists
      and `git -C <primary> check-ignore -q <dir>/` succeeds;
   3. `.cca/` in the primary repo, when `git -C <primary> check-ignore -q .cca/`
      succeeds;
   4. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs/`.
3. The run id is `<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<slug>`, local time. The slug is the first
   bundle's name followed by its PR number, or its branch name when it has no PR, both
   as the manifest or the prompt input gave them (no `gh` call), lowercased, with runs
   of characters outside `a-z0-9` turned into one `-`, at most 40 characters. For a
   bundle whose PR is a `file:` export, the PR part is the export's `id` (section B)
   or, failing that, the bundle's `branch`, never the file path. When
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs.json` already has that id or `<scratch>/cca/<run-id>/`
   exists, add `-2`, then `-3`, and so on. This check is a first pass, made with no
   lock: D4 and D6 settle the id.
4. The run directory is `<scratch>/cca/<run-id>/`, one `cca` level below `<scratch>`
   even when `<scratch>` itself ends in `cca`: `"scratch": "./app/.test-output/cca"`
   gives `.test-output/cca/cca/<run-id>/`, the doubled `cca` intended. Before the
   `mkdir`, write out the resolved run directory and the resolved `<scratch>/cca`, each
   as a whole path, and check that the parent of the first is the second, compared as
   whole paths: a parent merely named `cca` would pass `.test-output/cca/<run-id>/`.
   Then create `<scratch>/cca/` with `mkdir -p` when missing, then the run directory
   with `mkdir` and no `-p`. Use that same path as the `path` of the `runs.json` entry
   (D6) and as the directory `stages.json` is written in (D7). When that `mkdir` fails
   because the directory exists, another run made it first: take the next suffix per
   D3 and create again. Append the invocation block to `invocations.md` in it
   (SKILL.md, Invocation block).
5. State the merged, normalized manifest to the user as a fenced JSON block and save
   it as `manifest.json` in the run directory.
6. Add the run to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs.json` with `state: running` (read the
   array under the lock per SKILL.md, State files). Under the lock, after the fresh
   read, when any entry already has this `run_id`, or, before acquiring, when a stale
   lock's owner directory has this run's own `<owner>` name (that section's guard),
   add nothing: release the lock this run holds, if any, and never another's; remove
   this run's directory (this run alone created it at D4); and stop before stage 1
   with one line naming the id and saying that another audit took it in the same
   minute, so run the command again. That stop is not a registry failure. On refusal
   or failure, continue per that section's three cases; if the entry is absent, use
   its immediate warning, brief limitation, and manual-entry fallback.
7. Write `stages.json` with `plugin_version` `0.10.0`, empty `approvals`, and a stage 1
   entry with status `running` and inputs: the hashes of `manifest.json`, each claims
   file, the questions file, and every `file:` ticket or PR export, and
   `plugin_version`. Step 10 adds the shas, `forge_hashes`, and `forge_gaps` to the
   final entry.

## Steps

### 1. Fetch approval and baseline

a. For each audited repo (bundles, references, sources of truth), decide which refs
   are missing or stale: a ref is missing when
   `git -C <repo> rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}` fails; a bundle's head is stale
   when the PR's `headRefOid` is not the sha of any local ref, or is not present
   (`git -C <repo> cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` fails); a GitHub PR bundle's base is
   missing when `<remote>/<baseRefName>` does not resolve locally. A present base ref
   may be behind the branch, and nothing but a fetch can tell, so the base fetch below
   is always part of the question for every GitHub PR bundle, and for every bundle
   whose `base` is a remote-tracking ref `<remote>/<branch>`; a run with such a bundle
   therefore always asks once. On decline, the local base ref is used as is and the
   brief records "base: local ref, refresh declined", which the report's Coverage
   repeats. Ask the user once, in a sentence that says first why the fetch is needed (the local
   copy of the base or PR may be missing or behind, and a fetch updates only
   remote-tracking refs, never a branch or a file), then lists each repo, remote, the refs
   involved, and the
   exact fetch commands below, for approval to `git fetch`. Record the answer in `stages.json`
   `approvals` with kind `fetch`, target `<repo name>:<remote>`, the decision, the
   time, `commands`, the exact fetch commands actually run, and `resolved`, a map from
   each bare name to the kind the check found (`tag` or `branch`), one entry per repo
   and remote.
   For each missing bare name, the question lists the check
   `git -C <repo> ls-remote --tags <remote> refs/tags/<name>` (a printed line means it
   is a tag) and both candidate fetch commands: the tag refspec if it is a tag, the
   branch refspec otherwise. Nothing contacts a remote before approval; on approval,
   run the `ls-remote` check first, then the matching fetch. The approval for a bare
   name covers the check and either candidate command for that name; under
   `/cca:resume`, the recorded `resolved` kind picks the candidate, so resume matches
   it against `commands` without contacting the remote.
   On approval, run only these fetches (and the `ls-remote` check), which take no tags
   and write remote-tracking refs only. `--refmap=` (empty) keeps a configured fetch
   refspec of the remote, such as `+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*`, from also writing its own
   destination; `--no-tags` alone does not stop that:
   - for a GitHub PR bundle whose head is missing or stale:
     `git -C <repo> fetch --no-tags --refmap= <remote> +refs/pull/<n>/head:refs/remotes/<remote>/pr/<n>/head`
   - for a GitHub PR bundle, always, and for any bundle whose `base` is a
     remote-tracking ref `<base remote>/<baseRefName>`, where `<base remote>` is the
     remote the ref itself names (a configured remote of the repo, whether or not it
     is the selected one, present ref or not), else the selected remote:
     `git -C <repo> fetch --no-tags --refmap= <base remote> +refs/heads/<baseRefName>:refs/remotes/<base remote>/<baseRefName>`
     (a second remote is listed in the same question with target
     `<repo name>:<base remote>`)
   - for a missing ref that is a 40-hex sha:
     `git -C <repo> fetch --no-tags --refmap= <remote> +<sha>:refs/remotes/<remote>/cca/<sha>`;
     when the remote refuses (not every server serves arbitrary shas), stop `blocked`
     naming the sha, and resolve it as `<remote>/cca/<sha>` from then on;
   - for a missing ref `<name>` that is a tag on the remote:
     `git -C <repo> fetch --no-tags --refmap= <remote> +refs/tags/<name>:refs/remotes/<remote>/tags/<name>`,
     and resolve it as `<remote>/tags/<name>` from then on;
   - for any other missing ref: when the ref is `<other>/<branch>` and `<other>` is a
     configured remote of the repo (`git -C <repo> remote`), split it there and run
     `git -C <repo> fetch --no-tags --refmap= <other> +refs/heads/<branch>:refs/remotes/<other>/<branch>`
     (when `<other>` is not the selected remote, the question lists it, under the same
     approval, with target `<repo name>:<other>`); a prefix that is not a configured
     remote makes the whole ref a bare branch name that contains a slash. When it is a
     bare `<branch>`, fetch the same refspec from the repo's selected
     remote and resolve the ref as `<remote>/<branch>` from then on, since the fetch
     never writes a local branch.

   A bundle with `head: working-tree` takes no head fetch, and the stale-head test does
   not apply to it: its head does not exist until step 1c. Its base fetch is as above.

   Every ref that resolves under another name is recorded as one mapping line in the
   brief's Read paths: `<ref as given> -> <remote>/<branch>`,
   `<ref as given> -> <remote>/tags/<name>`, or `<sha> -> <remote>/cca/<sha>`. Resume
   resolves each ref through these lines before `rev-parse`. A ref that still cannot
   be fetched stops the run `blocked` naming it, before step 1b.

   A remote configured with `remote.<name>.prune` may also delete stale remote-tracking
   refs; `--prune` is never added, and this is accepted as part of the approved fetch.
   After fetching, verify with `git -C <repo> cat-file -e <sha>^{commit}` that each
   pinned head sha exists, and with `git -C <repo> rev-parse --verify <ref>^{commit}`
   that every other fetched ref, and for a GitHub PR its base ref
   `<remote>/<baseRefName>`, now resolves; if one does not, stop `blocked` naming the
   sha or ref. On decline, a bundle whose head or base still does not resolve stops the
   run `blocked` with the reason. Under `/cca:resume`, a recorded approval covers only
   the commands in its `commands` list. When the planned commands for a repo and
   remote are all in one recorded list for that target, they are not asked again.
   Otherwise ask once, as above, listing the new commands, and record a new approval
   entry.
b. Take the read-only baseline now, before any other work. For each audited repo
   `<name>`, with `baseline/` created in the run directory first, run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/readonly.sh snapshot <repo> <run dir> <run dir>/baseline/<name>`
   with the resolved absolute script path. It writes `baseline/<name>.marker` (its own
   marker, created first) and `baseline/<name>.status`, `.refs`, `.stash`, `.config`,
   `.hashes`, and `.ignored`. A repo that appears in more than one role is snapshotted
   once. A non-zero exit ends the run `blocked`, since the boundary cannot be checked;
   show the script's message.
c. For each bundle with `head: working-tree`, build its head now, right after the
   baseline, so the stage's read-only check covers any edit made between the baseline and
   the build. Run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/working-tree.sh build <repo>` with the
   resolved absolute script path. It builds a commit from the working tree in a temporary
   index copied from the repo's own, so the repo's index, refs, and files are untouched,
   and a file staged despite an ignore rule is kept; its only writes to the repo are git
   objects. It runs the same refusal checks as A.4's `check` first. Exit 0 prints, on
   stdout, `head <sha>`, `parent <sha>`, `tree <sha>`, one `untracked <path>` line per
   untracked file that is not ignored, and one `flagged <path>` line per skip-worktree or
   assume-unchanged path, which the head holds at its index version (the top level first,
   then each checked-out submodule, its paths with the submodule's prefix); keep every
   line. The head commit has no ref, and the same working tree and `HEAD` give the same
   sha. A line on stderr with exit 0 is a git warning, not a refusal: the run goes on, and
   it is not shown as a reason. Exit 1 is a refusal (a missing `HEAD` commit, a repo or
   checked-out submodule with no index file, a sparse checkout in the top level or a
   checked-out submodule, flagged paths the build cannot hold at the index version or
   cannot check on disk, unmerged paths, a dirty submodule or an untracked nested
   repository, a Git LFS or program filter, or a path git prints quoted): the script
   writes one line per reason on stderr, before it writes anything; end the run
   `blocked` and show those lines. Exit 2 (usage, not a work tree, a git step failed, or,
   after objects are written, a flagged path of the top level is not at its index
   version in the built tree; one line on stderr) ends the run `blocked` the same way.

### 2. Forge data

For each bundle, save under `forge/<bundle>/`:

- `pr.md`: title, body, state, reviews, and review threads (file, line, comments),
  rendered from `pr.json` and `pr-threads.json` below (`pr.json` is raw, so the author
  of a review or comment is its `author.login`). For an export, copy its content.
- `<ticket>.md` for each ticket in the bundle, and each ticket the PR's
  `closingIssuesReferences` names: text, state, acceptance criteria, fields, links,
  comments, rendered from the ticket's `.json` below (for a GitHub ticket, the pull
  requests that close it, from `closed_by`, are listed under links, and its parent, from
  `<ticket>.parent.json`, is written as `parent: github:<repo>#<number>`, or
  `parent: none`, or `parent: not read` when that read failed, below). For an export,
  copy its content.

Every saved `.md` file starts with a provenance block: the source (`gh`, or the export's
`source`, `exported_by`, and `exported_at`), and the time it was read. When no forge
was queried for a bundle, the brief says so.

For a GitHub PR or issue, the `gh` calls below write their output by shell redirect,
unchanged (never through the model), beside the rendered files. The hashed content is
a fixed projection of the fields, not the raw JSON, because viewer-dependent fields
such as `viewerDidAuthor` and reactions, would otherwise change the hash and
invalidate stage 1 on resume under another login; the head and base shas are left out
because resume step 3 compares them first and stops on a change. Resume runs these
identical
commands and the same `jq` projection.

Every read names the host of the PR or ticket it reads, `github.com` included: `<host>`
is that PR's or ticket's host from A3 (for a ticket that comes only from
`closingIssuesReferences`, the host of its `url` in `pr.json`), and a parent read uses
its ticket's host. Without it, gh uses its default host (`GH_HOST`, else the only saved
login), which can differ from the bundle's host. When a `gh` read of this step fails:

- a ticket the manifest or a prompt input names: stop the run with one line that names
  the host it queried and says to give that ticket id as a URL when that host is wrong;
- the review threads: stop the run with one line that names the read and the host;
- a ticket known only from `closingIssuesReferences`, or the parent read of any ticket:
  record a gap and go on. Its host came from a read that succeeded, so the failure is
  not a wrong host: the token may not reach that repository, or a GitHub Enterprise
  Server version may have no `parent` field on its GraphQL `Issue` type. Remove the file
  the redirect left, write `<ticket>.md` saying the ticket was not read, or give its
  parent as `parent: not read`, and list the gap in the brief's Forge section beside the
  "not in export" keys, with the host and the first line of gh's error. The file it
  would have written is neither a stage 1 output (step 10) nor in `forge_hashes`.
  Step 10 records the read in `forge_gaps` instead, a map from that run-relative path
  to the ticket's URL (its `url` in `pr.json` for a closing issue), so resume retries
  it.

- `forge/<bundle>/pr.json`, the one `gh pr view` call, unprojected (section C runs it
  and parses it; no second call is made):
  `gh pr view <n> -R <host>/<owner>/<repo> --json number,url,title,body,state,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,baseRefOid,closingIssuesReferences,reviews,comments > forge/<bundle>/pr.json`
- `forge/<bundle>/pr.hash.json`, the hashed form of the PR, a `jq` projection of
  `pr.json` that leaves out `baseRefOid`, `headRefOid`, and the viewer-dependent
  fields:
  `jq '{number,url,title,body,state,headRefName,baseRefName,closingIssuesReferences: [.closingIssuesReferences[] | {number, url}],reviews: [.reviews[] | {author: .author.login, state, body, submittedAt}], comments: [.comments[] | {author: .author.login, body, createdAt}]}' forge/<bundle>/pr.json > forge/<bundle>/pr.hash.json`
- `forge/<bundle>/pr-threads.json`, the review threads:
  `gh api --hostname <host> --paginate repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments --jq '.[] | {id, path, line, original_line, commit_id, body, user: .user.login, created_at, updated_at, in_reply_to_id}' > forge/<bundle>/pr-threads.json`
- `forge/<bundle>/<ticket>.json`, one per GitHub ticket:
  `gh issue view <n> -R <host>/<owner>/<repo> --json number,url,title,body,state,labels,comments,closedByPullRequestsReferences --jq '{number,url,title,body,state,labels: [.labels[].name], closed_by: [.closedByPullRequestsReferences[] | {number, url}], comments: [.comments[] | {author: .author.login, body, createdAt}]}' > forge/<bundle>/<ticket>.json`
- `forge/<bundle>/<ticket>.parent.json`, the parent of each GitHub ticket,
  `{"parent":null}` when it has none. `gh issue view` has no parent field, so this is a
  GraphQL read:
  `gh api --hostname <host> graphql -f query='query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $n: Int!) { repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) { issue(number: $n) { parent { number url repository { nameWithOwner } } } } }' -f owner=<owner> -f repo=<repo> -F n=<n> --jq '{parent: (.data.repository.issue.parent | if . then {number, url, repo: .repository.nameWithOwner} else null end)}' > forge/<bundle>/<ticket>.parent.json`

Hash `pr.hash.json`, `pr-threads.json`, and each `<ticket>.json` and
`<ticket>.parent.json` with `git hash-object --no-filters <file>`; the threads, ticket,
and parent files are hashed as written (their `--jq` output is already the projection),
and `pr.json` itself is never hashed. Step 10 records the hashes in the stage 1 entry's
inputs as `forge_hashes`, a map from run-relative path (such as
`forge/<bundle>/pr.hash.json`) to hash. Exports
(`file:` tickets and PRs) have no `.json` file and no entry in `forge_hashes`; their
content hashes are in D7.

### 3. Shas

For each bundle, record:

- head sha and base sha (both from step C3: the head is the PR's `headRefOid` for a
  GitHub PR, else what the `branch` ref resolves to; the base is what the base ref
  resolves to, for a GitHub PR `<remote>/<baseRefName>`, always with
  `git -C <repo> rev-parse <ref>^{commit}` after step 1a (and its fetch, when one was
  approved), never the PR's `baseRefOid`). Wherever the steps below write `<base>` and
  `<head>`, use these shas. For a bundle with `head: working-tree`, the head is the
  `head` sha step 1c printed, and its `parent` and `tree` shas are recorded too (step
  10.6 puts them in the stage 1 inputs);
- merge-base sha: `git -C <repo> merge-base <base> <head>`;
- commits on the base since the merge-base: `git -C <repo> log --oneline <head>..<base>`;
- files changed on both sides since the merge-base: the intersection of
  `git -C <repo> diff --name-only <base>...<head>` and
  `git -C <repo> diff --name-only <head>...<base>`;
- the run-once list, for a bundle with `run_once` only. Patterns are repo-relative and
  follow git's glob pathspec rules (`*` does not cross `/`, `**` does). With the
  merge-base, base, and head shas known, list the changed files that match:
  `git -C <repo> diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv --no-color --name-status -M <base>...<head> -- ':(glob)<pattern>' ...`, one
  pathspec per pattern, three dots as in step 4 (a `head: working-tree` bundle uses its
  built head sha the same way). The `-M` makes a rename show as `R` whatever the user's
  `diff.renames` setting is. In a three-dot diff the old side is the merge-base, so the
  status letter alone says whether a file exists there. `M`, `D`, and `R` with any score
  exist at the merge-base, and a rename is listed by its new path, with its old path and
  its score (`R067`). `--name-status` prints the status and score, then the old path, then
  the new path. `A` is new, and so is the new path of a `C` (copy) entry, which is listed
  with its source path. The pathspec hides an old path that matches no pattern, so a file
  moved in from outside the patterns shows as `A` and is listed as new. The command only
  reads. A `run_once` key that matches no changed file gives the list `none`. A bundle
  without the key has no list.

For every reference and source of truth with a `path`, record its pinned sha:
`git -C <path> rev-parse <ref>^{commit}`.

### 4. Diffs

For each bundle, write:

- `diffs/<bundle>.diff`: `git -C <repo> diff --no-ext-diff --no-textconv --no-color <base>...<head>`.
- `diffs/<bundle>.stat`: `git -C <repo> diff --numstat <base>...<head>`, one file per
  line with added and deleted counts (`-` for binary files).

Always three dots. A two-dot diff is never used, because it shows changes on the base
as reversals on the head.

### 5. Stacks

When one bundle's base sha, or base ref, is another bundle's head, record the stack in
order. The brief states the combined state under audit: each bundle at its head, with
stacks read in order, each bundle's diff taken against the bundle below it.

### 6. Readable trees

For every bundle at its head sha, and every reference and source of truth at its
pinned sha, decide how agents read it:

1. **Direct**: when `git -C <repo> rev-parse HEAD` is that sha,
   `git -C <repo> --no-optional-locks status --porcelain --untracked-files=no` is empty,
   and `git -C <repo> ls-files -v` shows no path flagged `S`, `h`, or `s` (skip-worktree
   or assume-unchanged). Agents read the
   checkout and search per the direct-read rules in `common.md`. A bundle with
   `head: working-tree` is direct when `git -C <repo> rev-parse HEAD` is the `parent`
   sha step 1c printed and step 1c printed no `flagged` line, which covers the
   checked-out submodules too; its modified and untracked files are part of the head, so
   the status condition does not apply. Its mode in the brief is
   `direct (working tree)`, and agents search it with
   `git -C <repo> grep <pattern> <head sha>` (`common.md`). A working-tree bundle with a
   `flagged` line is read from an export of its head, which holds the untracked files
   too and the flagged paths at their index version, never the local flagged files. A
   flagged path in a checked-out submodule is pinned by the submodule's commit and absent
   from the export, as every submodule path is.
2. **Export**: otherwise. First size it: the sum of blob sizes from
   `git -C <repo> ls-tree -r -l --full-tree <sha>`. Over 1 GB (1,073,741,824 bytes),
   ask the user first and record the answer in `approvals` with kind
   `export-over-1gb`. If declined, the repo is read with `git -C <repo> show
   <sha>:<path>`, and only agents with Bash may be assigned to it (every role but the
   merger). Otherwise export it:
   0. Remove `<run dir>/trees/<name>/` if it exists (`rm -rf`, inside the run directory
      only), so no file from an earlier export remains.
   1. List the tree: `git -C <repo> ls-tree -r -z --full-tree <sha>` into
      `trees/<name>.lstree`. Each entry is `<mode> <type> <object>\t<path>`, NUL
      terminated.
   2. Write every entry under `<run dir>/trees/<name>/` from one
      `git -C <repo> cat-file --batch` stream, with a script saved as
      `trees/<name>.export.sh` in the run directory and run with `sh`. The script
      reads the entry list, sends each blob's object id to `cat-file --batch`, and
      for each reply header `<oid> <type> <size>` copies exactly `<size>` bytes with
      `head -c <size>` into the file and discards the one newline that follows.
      Where `head -c` may read ahead (non-GNU `head`), write each blob instead with
      `git -C <repo> cat-file blob <oid> > <file>`.
   3. By mode:
      - `100644`: a regular file.
      - `100755`: a regular file with the executable bit.
      - `120000` (a symlink): a regular file holding the blob's content, which is the
        link target. List it in the brief. Never dereference it.
      - `160000` (a submodule): list its path and commit in the brief; do not export.
   4. A blob whose content starts with `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1`
      is a Git LFS pointer and is exported as the pointer file. List these in the
      brief and say the content is the pointer, not the object.
   5. A path containing a newline is not exported and is listed in the brief.
   `cat-file` reads objects only, so no checkout filter, smudge or process driver, or
   attribute runs. Never use `git archive` (it honors `export-ignore` and
   `export-subst`) or `git checkout-index` (it runs configured filters, which can reach
   the network or write outside the run directory), and never check out, switch, or
   add a worktree.

The brief maps each name to the path agents must read, the sha, and the mode (`direct`,
`direct (working tree)`, `export`, or `git show`). An export holds tracked files only, so
no test or lint command runs in an export, whether or not it needs installed dependencies;
a check run is done only in a directly read tree, and otherwise the question is marked
"not run". Step 6b is the one exception: the orchestrator runs a bundle's own test
command in its own copies, outside the run directory and every audited repo, and agents
read the result.

Classify each source of truth with a `path` for stages 2 and 3: count the tracked files
at the pinned sha by extension; when more than half are documents (`.md`, `.mdx`,
`.markdown`, `.txt`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.asciidoc`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.pdf`), it is a
**document corpus**, else a **code base**. Record the class and the counts in the brief.

### 6b. Changed tests with the change reverted

Only the orchestrator runs this step. First, whatever the manifest holds, remove
`<run dir>/revert/` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/revert-work/<run id>/` if they exist
(`rm -rf`, those two directories only), so nothing from an earlier attempt, or from a run
that was killed, remains. Then, for each bundle with `test_command`, in manifest order:

1. Write `revert/<bundle>.keys` with the Write tool, from the saved manifest, one line
   per value, `<key><TAB><value>`: `command` (the `test_command`), `setup` (the
   `test_setup`, when given), `timeout` (the `test_timeout`, when given), one `run` line
   per `test_run` pattern, and one `path` line per `test_paths` pattern (none when the
   key is absent, so the default list applies). No key's text passes through a shell
   command line.
2. Start, with the resolved absolute script path and the Bash tool's
   `run_in_background` set to true,
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/revert-tests.sh bg <repo> <base> <head> <run dir>/revert/<bundle>.keys ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/revert-work/<run id>/<bundle> <run dir>/revert/<bundle>.md`,
   with the base and head shas of step 3 (a `head: working-tree` bundle uses its built
   head sha). The script lists the bundle's changed test files, builds two copies with
   step 6's `cat-file` method in its work directory, one of the head and one of the
   merge-base with the test code at its head state, runs each file in both, writes one
   verdict per file to the result file, and removes its work directory. Its header gives
   the rules and the caps: 20 files, `test_timeout` per command, 30 minutes per bundle,
   and no run when a tree holds over 1 GB. A bundle can take longer than one foreground
   command may run. Then run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/revert-tests.sh wait <run dir>/revert/<bundle>.md`
   in the foreground with the Bash tool's `timeout` set to 600000. It returns within 9
   minutes; while it exits 3 (still running), run it again, at most 8 times in all. Do
   not end the turn while the run is in the background: in a headless session the turn's
   end ends the session. A completion notification for the background call changes
   nothing; `wait` still decides, and answers at once when the run is done.
3. `wait` exit 0: the result file is written, whatever its verdicts. Exit 2: stop the run
   with its stderr line, as for any stage 1 failure; it names a wrong key, a failed git
   step or write, a process group still live after KILL, a run stopped at its one-hour
   deadline or ended with another status, or no run started. After the eighth exit 3, stop the run with
   `revert-tests: no result after 72 minutes` and the background call's output file.

The commands run with the user's environment and credentials, as an agent's test run
in a directly read tree does, with `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` in the
work directory. Their output tails are recorded unredacted. Agents read
`revert/<bundle>.md` as `common.md`'s "Reverted test runs" says. Resume runs this step
only when stage 1 reruns.

### 7. Claims

Write `claims.md` from every claims file, numbered from 1 across all files, in file
order. One claim per line, in these shapes:

```
<n>. [claim:<kind>] <bundle>/<ticket or none> <source file>:<line> (<handoff ref>): <text> -> <target>
<n>. [claim:<kind>] <bundle>/<ticket or none> <source file>:<line>: <text> -> <target>
<n>. [other] <bundle or none>/<ticket or none> <source file>:<line>: <text> -> none
```

The first shape is for a handoff's claims, the second for a prose claims file's, the
third for a prose sentence that is not a claim. `<ticket>` is the manifest's normalized
id when the handoff id maps to one (section B, step 8), else the handoff's id.
`<target>` is a group id from `groups.md`, or `hygiene`; step 9 appends it.

The kinds, and for prose the typing rule (the first that applies, in this order):

1. `verification`: says something was checked, tested, verified, confirmed, reproduced,
   or passes.
2. `decision`: states a choice made or rejected, a deferral, or who decided.
3. `scope`: says what belongs in or out of the bundle, or ranks a ticket for inclusion.
4. `status`: a work item's type, state, iteration, owner, or links.
5. `code`: any other checkable statement about code, data, or behavior.

A handoff's claims come from
`sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh claims <file>`: one claim per
output line, never split further, with the kind, ref, bundle, ticket, line, and text
the script gives (never a kind chosen by judgment). The handoff's other lines are not
listed. A prose claims file keeps the sentence split: every sentence, in file order,
with a kind by the rule above for a checkable statement about the work, and `other` for
anything else. Headings, list items, and table cells count as sentences. Nothing is
dropped; a sentence split across lines takes its first line. Tag each with the bundle
and ticket it concerns, or `none`.

### 8. Groups

Map every changed file in every bundle's `.stat` to a review group in `groups.md`.
Group ids are lowercase slugs: a ticket's group is `<bundle>-<ticket number or file
name>`; the fixed groups are `unticketed` and `cross-cutting`.

With a manifest `groups` key, it replaces the derivation, the extraction, and the
merge: each entry is a group whose id is its `name` slug validated in section A step 3;
its globs are relative to the entry's `repo`; a file matching two entries goes to both
with a note; changed files no entry
matches go to `unticketed`. Skip to the format below.

Otherwise derive, per bundle:

1. A ticket's commits are those whose message names the ticket's id token: for a GitHub
   issue `github:owner/repo#n`, `owner/repo#n`, and `#n` when the issue is in the bundle's
   repo; for an exported ticket, its `id`, or, when the bundle has `ticket_token`, each
   pattern with `{n}` replaced by the `id` as written, in place of the bare `id`. A
   pattern is a literal template, never a regex: every character but `{n}` stands for
   itself, so `.` in `ticket.{n}` is a dot. A GitHub ticket keeps its own tokens. A token
   matches only when the character before it, if any, and the character after it, if any,
   are neither a letter nor a digit; for a pattern, the whole token is the unit, so the
   rule applies outside it.
   Before a GitHub token the character is also not `-`, `_`, `.`, or `/`, since those join
   owner and repo names. So `#12` does not match `#123`, `owner/app#12` does not match
   `other-owner/app#12`, and `APP-1` does not match `APP-10`, `APP-1a`, or `XAPP-1`, but
   it matches in `feature/APP-1`. With the pattern `#{n}`, a commit `fix(#4567 #4568)` is
   both tickets' commit, and `build 4567 passed` and `AB#4567` are neither's (the letters
   before `#` break the boundary); `AB#{n}` matches `AB#4567`; `[{n}]` matches only the
   bracketed `[4569]`. In a bundle with one ticket, every commit is that ticket's. The
   commits a handoff lists for the ticket are also its commits: run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/handoff.sh commits <file>` (one
   `<bundle>`, `<sha>`, `<ticket>`, `<line>` per line, tab-separated) and match each sha
   by prefix among the bundle's commits from the merge-base to the head
   (`git -C <repo> log --format=%H <merge-base>..<head>`). A handoff commit that matches
   no commit or more than one, and a commit whose message names another ticket than the
   handoff gives, is noted in the brief's Handoff section. Groups follow the union of
   both sets.
2. A ticket's group holds the changed files that the PR description, the commit
   messages, or the ticket text name (by path or by file name), and every changed file
   touched by any of that ticket's commits. A file touched by several tickets' commits
   goes to each of those groups, with a note naming the tickets.
3. Files no ticket explains go to `unticketed`.
4. A file whose mapping is uncertain is listed in both groups with a note saying why.
5. **Extraction.** A file present in more than two derived groups moves to
   `cross-cutting`, and stays listed in each former group with the note
   `moved to cross-cutting`.
6. **Merge.** After extraction, two ticket groups merge when each has more than half of
   its remaining files in the other. Check pairwise in ticket order, once; a merged
   group is not checked again. The merged group's id joins both with `+`, and the brief
   records the merge.

Format:

```
## <group id>: <ticket id or entry name, or unticketed or cross-cutting>
- <bundle>:<path> (+<added> -<deleted>) [note]
```

Write the `unticketed` and `cross-cutting` sections only when they have at least one
file. Every changed file appears in at least one group. The tests, work-item hygiene, and
cross-bundle interaction specialists of stage 4 are scopes, not groups.

A `head: working-tree` bundle's head commit, `cca: working tree`, names no ticket. In a
bundle with more than one ticket, a file that only that commit changes is matched to a
ticket by name (rule 2) or goes to `unticketed`. The brief says so.

### 9. Claim assignment

Append ` -> <target>` to every `claim` line in `claims.md`:

1. Every `scope` and `status` claim goes to `hygiene`, which is not a group. Stage 4
   gives the `hygiene` claims to the `hygiene` scope at high, to `tests-hygiene` at
   medium, and to `combined` at low.
2. A `code`, `decision`, or `verification` claim goes to the group whose files it
   concerns; a claim about a `cross-cutting` file goes to `cross-cutting`.
3. Such a claim that names no file goes to its ticket's group when that group exists in
   `groups.md`; else to the first group in `groups.md` that holds a file of the
   claim's bundle; else to the first group in `groups.md`.
4. Never assign a claim to a group that is absent from `groups.md` or has no files.

`other` lines get ` -> none`. Before finishing the stage, check that every `claim`
line names `hygiene` or a group present in `groups.md` with at least one file, so each
claim has a scope that stage 4 schedules; reassign any that does not by rule 3.

### 10. Brief, common, tier, and the end of the stage

1. **Tier.** Count bundles, distinct tickets, and changed lines (added plus deleted
   across every `.stat`; binary files count 0 and are noted). The tier is the first
   row whose conditions all hold:
   - `low`: 1 bundle, 1 ticket, under 500 changed lines;
   - `medium`: up to 3 bundles, up to 5 tickets, under 5,000 changed lines;
   - `high`: anything else.
   `effort` other than `auto` overrides it. Write the tier and the reason, with the
   counts, or "set by --effort". At low, the brief notes that one auditor covers the
   ticket, tests, and work-item hygiene with the same checklist, a departure from
   separate specialists.
2. **Stage applicability.** Stage 2 is applicable when at least one source of truth is
   a document corpus, stage 3 when at least one is a code base. Record both in the
   brief.
3. **`audit-brief.md`**, with these sections: Scope (bundles, repos, PRs, tickets);
   Tier and reason; Bundles (head, base, merge-base, base commits since the merge-base,
   files changed on both sides, stack, the `ticket_token` patterns when the bundle has
   them, the run-once list of step 3 when the bundle has `run_once`: the patterns, then
   one line per file with its status letter and score, its path, for `R` and `C` its old
   path (`from <old path>`), and `exists at merge-base` or `new`, or `none`; for a
   bundle with `test_command`, step 6b's line: the path
   `revert/<bundle>.md` and its verdict counts line, or `no changed tests to run`; the
   head sha is recorded as `headRefOid` for a GitHub PR, and the
   pinned base sha is the local sha of `<remote>/<baseRefName>`; for a GitHub PR also
   `baseRefOid`, labeled "base as GitHub last evaluated it", for information only;
   resume compares the head and the pinned base; a `head: working-tree` bundle also
   gets its `parent` sha, its `tree` sha, that the head is a built commit with no ref,
   the files "untracked at audit time" one per line (part of the head, but possibly left
   out of the user's own commit),
   the paths "flagged at audit time, held at the index version" one per line, from
   step 1c's `flagged` lines (the head holds the index version, not the local file),
   the groups note of step 8, and for a GitHub PR the `headRefOid` and, when it differs
   from the local `HEAD`, a line saying so); Combined state; Sources of truth (the order
   used, each with its sha and class, and whether it replaced the default); References
   (each with its sha); Read paths (name, path, sha, mode; plus each ref mapping line from
   step 1a); Export notes (symlinks with targets, submodules, LFS pointers, skipped paths,
   declined exports); Forge (queried or not, per bundle; "not in export" keys); Questions;
   Stage applicability; Run directory (its path, and whether it is inside the session's
   repository); Test injection (the `_test` key, when present); Handoff (each handoff file
   with its hash and that it passed `handoff.sh check`, its claim counts by kind, the
   bundle and ticket mapping notes of section B, and the commit notes of step 8; "none"
   when no claims file is a handoff); Claims (a statement that every claim is assigned to
   a scope that stage 4 schedules, with the count per kind and per target); Corrections
   (filled in stage 5).
4. **`common.md`**: read the template `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/common.md` with
   the Read tool and write the copy to `common.md` in the run directory with the Write
   tool (not `cp`), filling its header: run id, run directory, tier, and the question
   list.
5. Run the read-only check (SKILL.md, Read-only check), which writes
   `baseline/1-check.md`.
6. Write the stage 1 entry: status `complete`, outputs `manifest.json`,
   `audit-brief.md`, `common.md`, `claims.md`, `groups.md`, every `diffs/` file, every
   `forge/` file, every `trees/<name>/` export with its `trees/<name>.lstree` and
   `trees/<name>.export.sh`, each `revert/<bundle>.keys` and `revert/<bundle>.md`, and
   `baseline/1-check.md`. Its inputs are those D7
   recorded plus each bundle's head, base, and merge-base sha (the pinned base is the
   local sha of the base ref; `baseRefOid` is recorded beside it for a GitHub PR, for
   information only), `head_parent` and `head_tree` for each `head: working-tree`
   bundle, the pinned sha of every reference and source of truth, `forge_hashes`, and
   `forge_gaps` (step 2; an empty map when no read was a gap).
7. Print the stage boundary line. With `budget: 0`, or `_test`
   `expire_budget_after_stage: 1`, the budget has now expired: go to stage 8. Otherwise
   start stages 2, 3, and 4 together.
