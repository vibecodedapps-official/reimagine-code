# Stage 8: report (orchestrator)

The orchestrator's procedure for stage 8. The preamble in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/SKILL.md` and the
run's `common.md` apply. The report's section headings and layout are in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/report.md`; this file says where each part comes from and how the verdict is
decided.

Stage 8 always runs, even after a failed stage or an expired budget. It does not run
when the run is `blocked`: then no report is written, the reason is printed, and every
finished stage file is kept.

Inputs: `converged.md`, `gate.md`, `ledger/5.md`, `ledger/6.md`, `ledger/7.md`, the
`pass1/` and `pass2/` files (Claims and Verified OK lists, attacked Verified OK lists, the
`## Decisions`, `## Scope`, and `## Outward trace` sections of pass one, and the
`## Claims challenged`, `## Decisions challenged`, `## Scope challenged`,
`## Outward trace challenged`, and `## Coverage gaps` sections of pass two),
`claims.md`, `audit-brief.md`, `manifest.json`, `stages.json`, `usage.md`,
`baseline/*-check.md`, and the live files: `late/adversary.md` (it holds the challenge
lines for the live claims, which are never ledger content), `live/findings.md`,
`live/claims.md`, and each `live/carried/<id>.md`, whichever exist. The results files
`live/results-<k>.md` that the derived files cite are read for each result's text,
approver, and time, and a `result_file` entry's text is its copy
`live/results-<k>/<line>.txt`, with its hash from `live/results-<k>/SHA256SUMS`; they
are never changed, so they are not hashed.

Recorded input hashes (`git hash-object --no-filters`): `converged.md`, `gate.md`, the
ledger files, `claims.md`, `audit-brief.md`, `manifest.json`, `late/adversary.md`,
`live/findings.md`, `live/claims.md`, each `live/carried/<id>.md`, and each `pass1/` and
`pass2/` file read, whichever exist (`absent` for a live file that does not exist, as
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/live.md` says). `stages.json` and `usage.md` are read but not
hashed: they are run state, not inputs, and stage 8's own entry is written into
`stages.json`, so a hash of it could never match on resume.

Outputs: `report.md`, `claims-verdicts.md`, and `work-items.jsonl`. The format of
`work-items.jsonl` is in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/work-items.md`; the format of
`claims-verdicts.md` is below, after the steps.

## Steps

1. **Write the stage 8 entry as `running`,** with the recorded input hashes above.

2. **Pick the source of items from what is on disk,** first match:
   1. `converged.md`, whenever it exists and the stage 7 entry records
      `"converged_check": "pass"`, whatever stage 7's status (a failed late adversary
      does not discard a checked merge): use its items, gates, and dispositions.
   2. Else, when `ledger/5.md` exists and the stage 5 entry does not record
      `"ledger_build": "failed"`, the ledger files that exist: one item per ledger
      finding, with its state after the last verdict it has in `ledger/5.md` and
      `ledger/6.md` (a `no verdict: ...` state, `output failed` included, earns no
      credit; `ledger/7.md` verdicts are not applied: path 2 runs only when no merge
      passed stage 7's checks, so they are unchecked). Path 2 never reuses
      `gate.md`, which may have been written before stage 7's checks failed. Compute each
      gate with `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/ledger.sh gate <run dir>
      --tier <tier> --stage6 <stage 6 status> --late failed`, per the rules in
      `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/stages/7-converge.md` step 4. Late verdicts are
      therefore not credited: in a path 2 report every `P`, `T`, and `X` finding is
      `provisional`, and the report's limits say why. Stage 6 credit stays, since stage 6
      is `complete` only after `check --through 6` passed. When the script exits nonzero
      (its `ledger: ` lines are on stderr, no output), or a ledger file it needs is
      missing, compute the gates by hand from the ledger files present under the same
      rules and note the script failure in the report's limits. A finding that has not
      passed the rules is `provisional`. The finding set is the ledger findings plus
      every active carried finding (`live/carried/<id>.md`), one item per
      id, each carried finding joined with its positions in `ledger/6.md`
      (and `ledger/7.md`, listed as unchecked) and gated by the live rule. A position on a finding whose live review
      has not completed is `pending review`: it is listed under the item and never sets
      its severity, label, or disposition (stage 7, step 6). Disposition: `dismissed` when
      its last verdict is `dropped` and no one asked to restore it, `contested` when
      verdicts disagree on existence or severity, else `agreed`.
   3. Else (no `ledger/5.md`, or stage 5 recorded the ledger build as failed) the
      `pass1/` and `pass2/` files: one item per finding, every one
      `provisional`, with the pass-two verdicts that exist, and the carried findings added
      the same way.

   In the fallback paths 2 and 3, stage 8 still assigns `C<n>` ids, sequential in
   ledger order (or file order for path 3), each item listing its finding id as
   absorbed, so every reported item can be named to `/cca:act`. Every finding not yet
   through the review gate is marked provisional.

3. **Decide the terminal state** from stages 1 to 7 only; stage 8's own entry is
   `running` at this point. `reported` when every applicable stage 1 to 7 is `complete`
   or `not_applicable` in `stages.json`. `partial` when any of them failed, is
   `running`, is missing, or the budget expired. The state is final only after step 12
   writes stage 8 `complete`; if step 11's read-only check fails, the run is `blocked`,
   as step 11 says.

4. **Count before deciding.** For each item whose gate is `counts`, find its counted
   severity, then write the counts into the report so a reader can check the verdict:
   - `agreed`: its severity.
   - `contested` with two positions:
     - equal severities: that severity;
     - one position is `dropped`: the item counts only if the keeping position's label
       is `verified fact`, at that position's severity; otherwise it does not count;
     - otherwise: the higher severity when the higher position's label is
       `verified fact`, else the lower severity.
   - `contested` with more than two positions: the highest position's label decides.
     When it is `verified fact`, the item counts at the highest severity; otherwise
     apply the two-position rule to the highest and the lowest positions.
   - `dismissed`: does not count.
   - `provisional` items never count, whatever their disposition.

   A label of `unverified assumption` caps a severity at `medium`, per `common.md`.

5. **Decide the verdict.**
   - Run `partial`: `audit incomplete`, with the counts so far. Never `ready to merge`.
   - Any counted item at `blocker` or `high`: `not ready`.
   - Else any counted item at `medium`: `merge after fixes`.
   - Else: `ready to merge`.

   The verdict line gives the verdict, counts by severity, by gate, and by disposition,
   and the number of `contested` items.

6. **Fill the template `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/report.md`**, in its twelve sections:
   1. Verdict, from steps 4 and 5, then the `next:` block of step 14.
   2. Findings by ticket, severity first: each item with its evidence, gate,
      disposition, item id (`C<n>`), and absorbed ledger ids. Each item sits under a
      heading `#### C<n>: <title>`, so the work-items validator can find it. A
      `provisional` item says which review it still lacks, from its reason in
      `gate.md`, or from the `gate` output when `gate.md` is not used (path 2).
   3. Verified as sound: every Verified OK item from the pass-one reports, marked
      `challenged` when a pass-two adversary's `## Verified OK challenged` list names
      it, else
      `not challenged`. At low tier every item is `not challenged`.
   4. Disagreements kept: every `contested` item with each position and its evidence.
   5. Recommended next steps.
   6. Code fixes by repo and file, with item ids.
   7. Work-item fixes: the ticket text to change, drafted. Drafted text names no model,
      agent, or tool. Also each operation in `work-items.jsonl` with its `W<n>` id, the
      op, the target, the item ids it covers, and its reason. Decide the operations here,
      numbered `W1` upward in this order; step 7 below writes `work-items.jsonl` from
      the same list, so the ids match.
   8. Decisions, in three parts:
      1. Decision ledger: each `decision` claim, with its class (`stale deferral`,
         `needs <owner>`, `default taken`, or `evidenced`), the three dimensions
         (resolution, authority, evidence) from the auditor's `## Decisions` entry, its
         reversibility class, the recommendation, and the owner, then the auditor's
         position and the adversary's, from `## Decisions challenged`, or the mark
         `not challenged` when that entry has no line. When they differ, both are kept
         and neither is picked. A claim the stage 4 entry records as `not assessed` is
         listed with that mark only: no class, dimensions, or adversary position.
      2. Raised tickets: each `scope` claim, with the fields of the auditor's
         `## Scope` entry (introduced by the bundle, fix inside the bundle's repos,
         cost, recommendation, the handoff's ranking, whether the facts or the
         recommendation differ from the handoff) and the adversary's position from
         `## Scope challenged`, or `not challenged` when that entry has no line. A `scope`
         claim recorded as `not assessed` is listed with that mark only.
      3. Other decisions: each decision the change made or needs that is not a
         `decision` claim, with the recommendation, the reason, and a reversibility
         class, `reversible`, `hard to reverse`, or `contract change`. A named owner
         only for `hard to reverse` and `contract change`, and only when the tickets or
         threads name one; else "owner not recorded".

      Decision and scope entries are report items, not findings: they get no `C<n>` id
      of their own, never enter a ledger, and never change the counts. A finding an
      entry names in its `finding:` field is in section 2 like any other.
   9. Live checks: one block per live check, in the format of `live.md`: a
      `#### live <finding id>` block for each finding with a live check, and a
      `#### live claim <n>` block for each env claim, keyed by claim number, with its
      environment and command. Fill each `status` line from `live/findings.md`,
      `live/claims.md`, the results files they cite, and the `live` approvals in
      `stages.json`: `not run: not approved`, or
      `run, approved by <who> at <time>: <result>; derived: <derived>; <reviewed | under review: <what it lacks>>`.
      For a result kept as a file, `<result>` is
      `in live/results-<k>/<line>.txt, sha256:<hex>`, with the hash from `SHA256SUMS`;
      this holds for each `earlier` result too. A finding is `under review` while its live review has not completed (its `gate.md`
      reason is `live result not yet reviewed`). Every result, the winner and each
      `earlier` one, is logged here as an access with its approver and time, as hard
      rule 5 requires. A check the user did not approve is listed as not run. A result is
      fed back with `/cca:resume <run-id> --live <file>`.
   10. Claims: every numbered claim in `claims.md` with its kind, then `true`, `false`,
       or `not verified`, and the finding or evidence, from the pass-one Claims lists as
       revised by later verdicts. A claim no list covers is `not verified`, and so is a claim
       the stage 4 entry records as `not assessed`, with the reason "not assessed". A
       `verification` claim is `true, reproduced` only when the audit reproduced the
       stated result itself; `false, contradicted` only with counter-evidence; else
       `not verified, not reproduced`, with the reason. A claim that a
       `## Claims challenged` line overturned shows both verdicts and is `contested`.
       A live claim (`live/claims.md`) takes its derived verdict: a derived
       `true, reproduced` with the late adversary's `upheld` (from `late/adversary.md`)
       stays `true, reproduced`; `overturned` makes it `contested`; and no line (the late
       adversary failed after the ladder) makes it `not verified, not reproduced`, with
       the reason "live result not challenged". An env claim with no live result stays
       `not verified, not reproduced`, reason `needs a live check: env <name>`.
       Say once, in this section, that reproducing a stated result does not show that
       the build session ran its stated check.
   11. Coverage, from `stages.json`, `audit-brief.md`, and the check files:
       - each handoff claims file: its path, its hash, and whether `handoff.sh check`
         validated it (from the brief's Handoff section);
       - the `work-items.sh` result from step 8 below: `work-items: ok`, the error
         lines and that the file is not ready for an adapter, or that it was not
         validated and why;
       - each stage run, not applicable, failed, or swapped, and why;
       - every swap by name, with the requested model for each agent (the report says
         "requested", not "used");
       - at low tier, that one auditor covered the ticket, tests, and work-item hygiene;
       - failed scopes and scopes not run because the budget expired, naming the last
         byte offset of a digest that ended `status: failed at byte <offset>`;
       - each `decision` or `scope` claim recorded as `not assessed` (the pass-one
         report has no entry for it), and each entry recorded as `not challenged`
         because pass two wrote no line for it;
       - the outward trace, read from the `pass1/` and `pass2/` files and the stage 4 and 5
         entries, so it shows even when pass two failed or never ran: each scope recorded
         as "outward trace: not assessed"; each `not traced:` symbol of a pass-one
         `## Outward trace`; each entry with result `incomplete`; each entry cut to
         `(<k> of <n> checked)`, a cut decision list included, with its `not listed:`
         locations; each `outward trace:` line of a pass-two `## Coverage gaps`; and the
         number of trace entries `not challenged`. A symbol on both lists shows once. None
         of these fails a scope or changes the counts;
       - each bundle whose base refresh was declined, from the brief's "base: local
         ref, refresh declined" line;
       - each `head: working-tree` bundle: the loose objects `working-tree.sh build`
         wrote to the repo's object store (an allowed write), that the head commit has
         no ref and `git gc` may prune it after its prune window, the files
         untracked at audit time, and the paths flagged at audit time (both from the
         brief); a flagged path is held at its index version, so its local content is
         not in the head, and a change to one during the run may escape the read-only
         check, which does not compare it;
       - stage 6: whether the mandatory ids were requested in batches (`batched`) and,
         from `missing_positions`, every mandatory id left without a position (those
         Codex was asked for and left unanswered after the follow-up, and those of a
         fallback batch that failed); a partial swap (the fallback answering the ids
         Codex was not asked for) is listed as a swap with its scope;
       - every file stage 2 split by byte range, from the stage 2 entry's `split_files`:
         the source, the path, its size, each range, and the chunk id (`digest-N`) that
         covered it with that chunk's status;
       - unanswered questions and departures from the stage plan;
       - map corrections not applied, from `ledger/5.md`;
       - when exports were used, that the forge was not queried;
       - ignored-file differences accepted by each read-only check, and what the check
         does not detect: an ignored file replaced with one of the same size and a
         restored modification time, changes inside `.git/` other than refs, stashes,
         and config, a change to a nested repository's refs other than its HEAD, its
         stashes, or its config, a change inside a repository that sits in an ignored
         directory, such as a linked worktree, other than an entry added or removed at
         its top level, and changes outside the audited repos. When any
         `baseline/<stage>-check.md` carries the note `note mtime precision: seconds`,
         say the ignored-file comparison used whole-second times, so a same-size rewrite
         within the same second was not detected;
       - the manifest's `_test` key, when present.
   12. Usage per stage, from `usage.md`: agents run, requested models, wall-clock, and
       tokens, each labeled "task notification, subagent_tokens; scope not documented";
       Codex tokens "not reported". No total is presented as exact.

   The filled body is written to `report.body.tmp` in the run directory, not yet to
   `report.md`. Section 11 (Coverage) is filled in two passes: everything except the
   `work-items.sh` result now, and that result in step 8.

7. **Write `work-items.jsonl`** in the run directory, from the operations listed in
   section 7, one JSON object per line, in the format in
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/work-items.md`. With no operations, the file is
   written empty.

8. **Validate it.** Run
   `sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/scripts/work-items.sh check work-items.jsonl report.body.tmp claims.md`
   from the run directory, with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolved as the preamble says.
   Put the result in the Coverage section of `report.body.tmp`, a text change that
   alters no item:
   - exit 0: `work-items: ok`;
   - exit 1: the file is kept, every error line is listed, and the file is marked not
     ready for an adapter;
   - exit 2: the file is kept, and Coverage says it was not validated, with the
     script's message (`work-items: jq not found` when `jq` is missing).

   Fix nothing in the report to satisfy the validator; a mismatch is reported, not
   hidden.

9. **Revision line.** With Bash, compute the hash over the exact bytes of
   `report.body.tmp` and assemble `report.md` with a shell redirect, so no byte is
   re-serialized. Use absolute paths for `<run dir>` with no `cd`; stop unless
   `hex` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters, writing no `report.md`
   on failure:

   ```
   hex=$( (sha256sum "<run dir>/report.body.tmp" 2>/dev/null || shasum -a 256 "<run dir>/report.body.tmp") | cut -d' ' -f1)
   case $hex in ''|*[!0-9a-f]*) printf 'no sha-256 hex: %s\n' "$hex" >&2; exit 1 ;; esac
   [ ${#hex} -eq 64 ] || { printf 'no sha-256 hex: %s\n' "$hex" >&2; exit 1; }
   { printf 'revision: sha256:%s\n' "$hex"; cat "<run dir>/report.body.tmp"; } > "<run dir>/report.md"
   ```

   The Write tool is never used for `report.md`, and the file is not edited after this
   step. The revision is the sha-256 of every byte after the first LF; stage 9
   recomputes it with `tail -n +2 report.md | { sha256sum 2>/dev/null || shasum -a 256; }`. Remove `report.body.tmp`.

10. **Write `claims-verdicts.md`,** in the format below, carrying the revision `<hex>`
    from step 9. Write it with the Write tool; it is not hashed.

11. **Read-only check.** Run the check in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/cca/SKILL.md` and write
    `baseline/8-check.md`. If it fails, the run is `blocked`: the report stays on disk,
    and step 14 prints the reason and `blocked` instead of a verdict.

12. **Write the stage 8 entry last,** once the check has passed, per the preamble:
    status `complete`, the recorded input hashes above, outputs
    `["report.md", "claims-verdicts.md", "work-items.jsonl"]`.

13. **Update `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runs.json`:** set this run's `state` to the terminal
    state under the lock per SKILL.md, State files. On refusal or failure, continue
    per that section's three cases: missing entry, old state, or correct registry
    with a leftover lock.

14. **Print and stop,** in plain words: the verdict said as a sentence, where the report is
    (the absolute path of `report.md`), and the terminal state. For `partial`, also say that
    `/cca:resume <run-id>` finishes the missing work, and print it, when this run's entry
    is in `runs.json`. For any terminal state when the entry is absent, print
    the JSON entry and resolved registry path for manual addition per SKILL.md,
    State files instead of a bare resume command, and say that the report's `/cca:act`
    and `--live` lines need the entry added first. Then print these lines, the same ones
    the report's `next:` block holds (`report.md`, section 1), computed from the report
    just written:
    - `act first: <ids, each with one short reason, or none>`. An item is listed when it
      is counted (not `provisional`), its disposition is `agreed`, its severity is
      `blocker`, `high`, or `medium` (the floor step 5 uses for `merge after fixes`),
      and its recommended change is inside the bundle's repos; order by severity, then
      id. A `low` or `note` item stays in the report and may be given to act; being left
      out of this line dismisses nothing, and the closing says so in a clause.
    - `/cca:act <run-id> <ids>`: the listed ids only, in that order; omit the line when
      none are listed. Only ids act accepts appear: report items `C<n>`. A decision or
      scope entry carries no `C<n>` and never appears, and a work-item operation
      (`W<n>`) is not an act argument. With no registry entry, still print this line,
      since act takes the run id, and say that act stops at its step 1.1 until the
      entry is added.
    - `your decision: <list, or none>`: items `contested` or `provisional`, each with
      what it lacks; items whose recommended change is outside the bundle's repos; and,
      from each of the three parts of section 8, the entries that are open and need the
      user's authority, each with the decision needed: decision claims of class
      `needs <owner>` or `stale deferral`; every scope claim, with its `include` or
      `defer` recommendation, since a recommendation is not the user's acceptance of
      it; and the other decisions the change needs and has not made. Entries the change
      already made (`evidenced`, `default taken`, and made decisions) stay in the report
      and are not listed.
    - `/cca:resume <run-id> --live <file>`, only when all of these hold: at least one
      Live checks block has `status` `not run: not approved` (a check still needing a
      result); this run's entry is in `runs.json`; and the preliminary rerun stage of
      `resume.md` step 4.2, computed as resume would now, is none or 6 or later, which
      at this point means every stage 1 to 5 entry has status `complete` or
      `not_applicable` and every output it lists exists (its inputs are as recorded).
      A `partial` run that fails that test gets the plain `/cca:resume <run-id>` line
      only, since `--live` would be refused. With the line, say: the file holds one
      `## <id>` section per check you ran, with the result lines, as `live.md`, "The
      `--live` file", says; resume rechecks eligibility and refuses the import once a
      bundle's recorded head or base no longer matches, so import before committing or
      pushing on the audited branch. A result already imported and `under review` needs
      no `--live`: plain `/cca:resume <run-id>` reconciles it (`resume.md` step 4.4),
      and the closing says so when that is the only open state.

    Nothing runs after this; `/cca:act` is a separate command.

## `claims-verdicts.md`

The return trip to the build session. Step 10 writes it from the report's section 10 and
the claims files, in this format:

```
# Claims verdicts: <run-id>

report revision: sha256:<hex>
generated: <time>

Apply a line only when its file hash and claim text match what you hold. `false` lines
are corrections: the statement is contradicted by the cited evidence. `not verified` lines
on verification claims are recheck requests: the audit could not reproduce the check, which
is not evidence the statement is wrong. `not reproducible here` lines are not recheck
requests: the check ran against an environment the audit cannot reach, so run it against
that environment and feed the result back with `/cca:resume <run-id> --live <file>`.
`contested` lines need a person to decide.

## <claims file absolute path> (handoff | prose), hash <git hash-object --no-filters>

- claim <n> [<kind>] <source file>:<line> <handoff ref or ->: <true | false | not verified | not reproducible here | contested>; finding: <C<n>, ... or none>; evidence: <pointer>
  ticket: <the claim's ticket id, or none>
  text: <the claim's text as in claims.md>
  correction: <text or none>
```

- One entry per `claim` line of `claims.md`: a main line and three sub-lines indented two
  spaces, `ticket:`, `text:`, and `correction:`. A sub-line holds the whole rest of its
  line, so a claim's text or a correction may contain `; `. Entries are grouped by claims
  file, in claim order. The file's hash is the one stage 1 recorded for that claims file
  in the `inputs` of its `stages.json` entry, so it names the bytes the audit read, not
  the file as it is now. `other` sentences are not listed.
- `ticket` is the ticket the claim is about, so a build session can find what it wrote
  about that ticket. For a handoff claim, it is the ticket field `handoff.sh claims`
  printed; for a prose claim, the ticket stage 1 tagged it with, an export written as its
  `id`; else `none`. A file written by 0.2.0 has no `ticket:` sub-line.
- `(handoff)` for a file `handoff.sh detect` accepted, else `(prose)`. The handoff ref
  is the one in the claim line, or `-` for a prose claim.
- `not reproducible here` is the verdict of an env claim (`common.md`, "Env claims") that
  no live result has settled. An env claim with a live result takes the verdict of the
  report's section 10 like any other.
- `contested` is used when the auditor's and the adversary's verdicts differ; both are
  given in the report's Claims section. Otherwise the verdict is the one in the report's
  section 10. For a `verification` claim, `true` means reproduced and not overturned.
- `correction` is the corrected text for a `false` line, drawn from the cited evidence;
  `none` for every other verdict. The text names no model, agent, or tool.
- `evidence` points to the report item (`C<n>`) or the evidence the verdict rests on.
