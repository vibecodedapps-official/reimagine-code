# working-tree.sh: build a commit from a repository's working tree, so a run can audit
# uncommitted work, without touching the repository's index, refs, or working tree.
#
# Usage:
#   sh working-tree.sh build <repo>
#   sh working-tree.sh check <repo>
#
# Portability: POSIX sh (dash, bash, Git Bash), and awk in forms mawk and gawk accept.
# Every intermediate goes to a file in one temporary directory, removed on every exit, and
# every git step's exit status is checked.
#
# build: GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, and GIT_INDEX_FILE from the caller are unset first, and
# every git call runs with GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0. The commit is built in a temporary index
# inside the script's own temporary directory, a copy (`cp -p`, so its mtime is kept) of
# the repository's own index, so the tree is what `git add -A && git commit` would make
# from the user's own index, a file staged with `git add -f` despite an ignore rule
# included. Then
# `add -A`, `write-tree`, and `commit-tree` with parent HEAD, which is resolved once,
# first. The git steps that touch the temporary index run with core.splitIndex=false and
# core.untrackedCache=false, so no shared index or cache lands in .git. Author and
# committer are `cca <cca@example.invalid>`, both dates `@946684800 +0000`, the message
# `cca: working tree`, `commit-tree` is passed --no-gpg-sign, and fsmonitor is off, so
# an unchanged working tree and HEAD give the same commit sha. Filters are never
# disabled: the tree holds what the user's own commit would.
#
# Every git call runs with hooks disabled (core.hooksPath is an empty directory in the
# temporary directory), since a hook such as post-index-change could write or reach a
# service. The submodule test reads `git status --porcelain=v2 --no-renames` (git 2.18 or
# later), so a renamed submodule is a type 1 entry like any other, not a type 2 rename.
#
# check: runs the refusal checks below and nothing else. It writes nothing (no temporary
# index, no object) and runs no filter, hook, or program: exit 0 with nothing printed, or
# exit 1 or 2 as `build` does. `build` runs the same checks first.
#
# Refusals: exit 1, on stderr, before any write, one line per reason that holds, in this
# order. A reason that names a path names the first one.
#   working-tree: refused: no HEAD commit
#   working-tree: refused: no index file in <path>
#   working-tree: refused: sparse checkout is on
#   working-tree: refused: sparse checkout is on in <path>
#   working-tree: refused: <n> flagged paths cannot be held at the index version, first <path>
#   working-tree: refused: unmerged paths, first <path>
#   working-tree: refused: submodule <path> has uncommitted changes or untracked files
#   working-tree: refused: untracked nested repository <path>
#   working-tree: refused: Git LFS filter on <path>
#   working-tree: refused: filter '<driver>' runs a program on <path>
#   working-tree: refused: unsupported path (git prints it quoted): <path>
# A flagged path (skip-worktree or assume-unchanged, `ls-files -v` tag S, h, or s) is
# held at its index version: the build copies the index with its flags, so `add -A`
# leaves the entry alone whether the file is edited or missing on disk. Five cases break
# that or cannot be verified, so they are refused: a flagged gitlink hides the submodule
# from the parent's `git status`, so the dirty submodule reason would not see it;
# `write-tree` leaves out an intent-to-add entry; when the path is a directory on disk
# (not a symlink), or a leading component of it is a symlink or anything but a directory,
# `add -A` adds what is on disk and drops the flagged entry; and a path git prints quoted
# cannot be tested on disk, so it is an unverifiable quoted path (a quoted file in a
# checked-out submodule is not refused as a quoted path). A dirty submodule's files, and
# an untracked nested repository's commits, are not in the parent's tree. A filter driver
# with a `clean` or `process` command in any config scope runs a program inside `add -A`,
# which may write or reach a service. A driver with neither key runs nothing, so git
# stores the file as is. Git LFS is always refused. When a filter reason holds,
# `git status` is not run, since it would run the filter, so the two submodule and nested
# repository reasons are then not reported.
# The filter scan covers the top level and then each checked-out submodule (a gitlink whose
# directory holds a .git), depth first, each with its own paths, attributes, and config,
# before any `git status`, which would run a submodule's filter on a modified file. A
# path in a submodule carries its prefix (`sub/x.dat`). One LFS line (the first path found
# overall), and one filter line per driver and repository (its first path).
# Every attribute value is a driver name, `set`, `unset`, and `unspecified` included (a
# string `filter=set` names a driver `set`); one is refused only when its `clean` or
# `process` key is set, as for any driver. A checked-out repository always has an index
# file, and the build copies it, so a top level or checked-out submodule with none is
# refused (`<path>` is `.` for the top level, else the submodule's path): a HEAD-only
# start would restore attributes the scan never saw. Like a filter reason, it skips
# `git status`. It is not checked without a HEAD commit. A submodule path git quotes, at
# any depth, is never scanned, so it is refused as a quoted path (the top level's first
# quoted path first, else the first such submodule, with its prefix) and also skips
# `git status`, which would recurse into it. The sparse checkout check also runs in every
# checked-out submodule: one line, for the first repository in scan order that has it on,
# naming a submodule by its path. So does the flagged path check: the count is summed
# over the repositories, and the first path is the first in scan order, with its prefix.
# After `write-tree`, each flagged path of the top level must be in the tree with the mode
# and object of its entry in the copied index, else exit 2 (`working-tree: flagged path
# <path> is not at its index version in the built tree`); the refusals make this safety
# net unreachable.
#
# Output, exit 0, on stdout:
#   head <sha>
#   parent <sha>
#   tree <sha>
#   untracked <path>          one per untracked, not ignored file, sorted
#   flagged <path>            one per flagged path, held at its index version, in scan
#                             order (the top level, then each checked-out submodule depth
#                             first, each in `ls-files` order), with the submodule prefix
# The only writes outside the temporary directory are the objects `add -A`, `write-tree`,
# and `commit-tree` put in the repository's object store. The commit has no ref.
#
# Exit status (`check` prints nothing on stdout. It runs the refusals only, not build's git
# steps, so it exits 0 where `build` would pass the refusals, even when a later step such
# as `add -A` under core.safecrlf=true makes `build` exit 2):
#   2  the arguments are wrong, <repo> is not a git work tree, or a git step failed (one
#      line on stderr; nothing is printed on stdout)
#   1  a refusal
