# Report template

Stage 8 fills this template into `<run dir>/report.md`, from what is on disk:
`converged.md`, the ledger files, the `pass2/` files, the Claims lists from pass one,
`stages.json`, and `usage.md`. Everything between `<` and `>` is filled in; every
section is present, with `none` when empty. Finding and item shapes are those in
`common.md`.

## Revision line

The report's first line is its revision:

```
revision: sha256:<hex>
```

`<hex>` is the SHA-256 of the file body below that line, byte for byte, as written.
Write the body first, hash it (`sha256sum`, or `shasum -a 256`), then write the file
with the revision line followed by the body. `/cca:act` binds its approval to this
line.

## Partial and blocked runs

- When a stage failed or the budget ran out, the report is still written, from
  whatever is on disk: `converged.md` when it exists, else the ledger files, else the
  `pass1/` and `pass2/` files. Every finding that has not passed the review gate is
  marked `provisional`. The verdict is `audit incomplete`, with the counts so far,
  never `ready to merge`. The terminal state is `partial`.
- When no report can be written, or the read-only check failed, the run is `blocked`
  and this template is not used; the reason is printed.

## Body

```
# cca audit report: <run-id>

run: <run directory> | tier: <tier> (<reason>) | terminal state: <reported | partial>
bundles: <bundle> <repo> <head sha> against <base> <base sha> (merge-base <sha>), ...
generated: <time>
```

For a `head: working-tree` bundle, `<head sha>` is followed by
`(working tree on <parent sha>)`, the built commit and the `HEAD` it sits on.

### 1. Verdict

`not ready`, `merge after fixes`, or `ready to merge`; in a `partial` run,
`audit incomplete`. Write the counts first, then the verdict, then the rule that
decided it, so a reader can check it.

Counts table: for each severity (blocker, high, medium, low, note), the number of items
by gate (`counts`, `provisional`) and by disposition (`agreed`, `contested`,
`dismissed`), plus the contested count.

The rules that count items and decide the verdict are in `stages/8-report.md`, steps 4
and 5, which are their single home; apply them there and write only their result here.

The verdict line reads:
`verdict: <verdict> | counted: <n> blocker, <n> high, <n> medium, <n> low, <n> note | provisional: <n> | contested: <n> | dismissed: <n>`

After the verdict line, a plain line `next:` heads the lines that
`stages/8-report.md` step 14 prints, which are its single home: `act first:`, the
`/cca:act` line, `your decision:`, and the `--live` resume line when step 14 prints it.
Write each as one line that starts with its label, and no heading. No line of the block
starts with `#### C`, `- claim `, or `#### live `, since `work-items.sh`, `memory.sh`,
and `live.sh` parse those, and the block adds no `###` or `####` heading. The block is
part of the body that the revision line hashes. It is written at step 6 from the report's
own content and the stage entries; the run's entry in `runs.json` is not a condition of
any line, and when the entry is absent at the close, the closing says the `/cca:act` and
`--live` lines need it added first.

### 2. Findings by ticket

Per ticket (then `unticketed`, then `cross-cutting`), items severity first. Each item
sits under a heading `#### C<n>: <title>`; the work-items validator finds items by it.
Under the heading: effective severity, gate, disposition, the absorbed ledger ids,
the evidence (as cited in the ledger), what breaks and for whom, and its state after
each stage (pass-two verdict, second opinion, late adversary). Provisional items are
marked `provisional` and say which review they still lack.

### 3. Verified as sound

Every Verified OK item from pass one, each marked `challenged` or `not challenged`
per the tier's pass-two rule: at low, none is challenged; at medium, up to 5 per
report are; at high, all are. A challenged item that failed the challenge moves to
section 2 as the finding it became and is noted here.

### 4. Disagreements kept

Every `contested` item: each position with its reviewer, severity, label, and
evidence, and the severity the verdict rule counted it at. No side is picked.

### 5. Recommended next steps

Ordered: what to fix before merge, what to check live, what to record as follow-up.

### 6. Code fixes

By repo, then file: each change, with the item ids it resolves.

### 7. Work-item fixes

Per ticket: the ticket text to change, drafted, with the item ids. Drafted text names
no model, agent, or tool.

Then each operation in `work-items.jsonl`, one line per operation: its `W<n>` id, the
op, the target, the item ids it covers, and its reason. These are drafts for a person
or an adapter; act applies none of them.

### 8. Decisions

Three parts.

- Decision ledger: each `decision` claim, with its class (`stale deferral`,
  `needs <owner>`, `default taken`, or `evidenced`), resolution, authority, whether
  alternatives were weighed, reversibility class, the recommendation, and the owner. The
  auditor's position and the adversary's follow, or `not challenged` when pass two wrote
  no line for the entry; when they differ, both are kept and no side is picked. A claim
  that is `not assessed` is listed with that mark only: no class, fields, or adversary
  position.
- Raised tickets: each `scope` claim, with whether the bundle introduced it, whether the
  fix is inside the bundle's repos, cost, the recommendation (`include` or `defer`) and
  its reason, the handoff's ranking, and whether the facts and the recommendation
  differ from the handoff, each stated on its own. The adversary's position follows, or
  `not challenged`. A `scope` claim that is `not assessed` is listed with that mark only.
- Other decisions: each decision the change made or needs that is not a `decision`
  claim: the recommendation, the reason, and a reversibility class (`reversible`,
  `hard to reverse`, or `contract change`). A named owner, from the tickets or threads
  only, for `hard to reverse` and `contract change`; otherwise "owner not recorded".
  Act may post a decision to its ticket as a drafted comment only when the user says to
  for that item.

Decision and scope entries are report items, not findings: they have no item id, never
enter a ledger, and never change the counts.

### 9. Live checks

One block per live check: each finding with a live check, and each env claim
(`common.md`, "Env claims"), keyed by claim number. Every value is a whole line, and the
format is the one in `live.md`:

```
#### live <finding id> | live claim <n>
- item: C<n> | claim <n>
- query: <the query or command, exactly as the check states it>
- where: <where it runs>                  (finding)
- env: <name>                             (env claim)
- results: <what each result changes>     (finding)
- status: not run: not approved | run, approved by <who> at <time>: <result>; derived: <derived>; <reviewed | under review: <what it lacks>>
```

For a result kept as a file, `<result>` is `in live/results-<k>/<line>.txt, sha256:<hex>`,
the copy and its hash from `SHA256SUMS`.

A result is fed back with `/cca:resume <run-id> --live <file>`. Every approved live
access, each result with its approver and time, is logged here. `none` when no finding
has a live check and no claim is an env claim.

### 10. Claims

Every numbered claim from `claims.md` with its kind (`code`, `decision`, `verification`,
`scope`, or `status`), then `true`, `false`, or `not verified`, and the item id or
evidence. `other` sentences are counted, not listed. A `decision` or `scope` claim with
no pass-one entry is `not verified`, with the reason "not assessed".

A `verification` claim is `true, reproduced` only when the audit reproduced the stated
result itself, `false, contradicted` only with counter-evidence, and otherwise
`not verified, not reproduced` with the reason. A live claim takes its derived verdict,
and `contested` when the late adversary overturned it, or `not verified, not reproduced`
when the late adversary gave no line. One line says that reproducing a stated
result does not show that the build session ran its stated check. Where the auditor's
and the adversary's verdicts differ, both are shown.

`claims-verdicts.md`, beside this report, carries these verdicts back to the build
session.

### 11. Coverage

- Handoffs: each handoff claims file, its hash, and whether `handoff.sh check`
  validated it.
- Work items: the `work-items.sh check` result for `work-items.jsonl`: `work-items: ok`,
  the error lines and that the file is not ready for an adapter, or that it was not
  validated and why.
- Stages: each stage 1 to 8 as `complete`, `not applicable`, `failed`, `swapped`, or
  `not run: budget expired`, with the reason.
- Swaps: every swap, with role, scope, from, to, and reason (including Codex swaps).
- Failed scopes and the files, rules, or questions they left unreviewed, naming the
  last byte offset of a digest that ended `status: failed at byte <offset>`.
- Each `decision` or `scope` claim that is `not assessed` (the pass-one report has no
  entry for it), and each entry that is `not challenged` because pass two wrote no line
  for it. Neither fails a scope or changes the verdict counts.
- Outward trace, read from the pass files and stage entries, so it shows when pass two
  failed or never ran: each scope whose trace is `not assessed`; each `not traced:`
  symbol; each entry with result `incomplete`; each entry cut to `(<k> of <n> checked)`,
  a cut decision list included, with its `not listed:` locations; each `outward trace:`
  line of a pass-two `## Coverage gaps`; and the number of trace entries
  `not challenged`. A symbol shows once. None fails a scope or changes the verdict
  counts.
- Each bundle whose base refresh the user declined ("base: local ref, refresh
  declined" in the brief): the base commit list and overlap set are as of that ref.
- Each `head: working-tree` bundle: the loose objects `working-tree.sh build` wrote to
  the repo's object store (an allowed write), that the head commit has no ref and
  `git gc` may prune it after its prune window, the files untracked at audit time, and
  the paths flagged at audit time, each held at its index version: its local content is
  not in the head, and a change to one during the run may escape the read-only check,
  which does not compare it.
- Each bundle with `test_command`: that stage 1 step 6b ran its changed test files with
  the change reverted, or that it found none to run; setup's exit status per copy, when
  `test_setup` is set; the verdict counts; every `not run` with its reason; the changed
  paths outside `test_paths`, whose tests were not measured; and that the bundle's own
  commands ran with the user's environment and credentials, in copies under cca's data
  directory that the step removed, and may have written outside the audited repos (an
  allowed write). Without `test_command`, nothing is listed.
- Stage 6: whether the mandatory ids were requested in batches (`batched`) and, from
  `missing_positions`, every mandatory id left without a position (those Codex was
  asked for and left unanswered after the follow-up, and those of a fallback batch
  that failed). A partial swap, the fallback answering the ids Codex was not asked
  for, is listed as a swap with its scope.
- Corpus files stage 2 split by byte range: the source, the path, its size, each
  range, and the chunk id (`digest-N`) that covered it with that chunk's status.
- Unanswered questions, and questions marked "not run".
- Departures from the original stage plan (for example, the low tier's single auditor
  covering tests and work-item hygiene).
- Read-only check: each `baseline/<stage>-check.md` result, and every ignored file
  accepted, with the run that wrote it. Not detected by the check: an ignored file
  replaced with one of the same size and a restored modification time, changes inside
  `.git/` other than refs, stashes, and config, a change to a nested repository's refs
  other than its HEAD, its stashes, or its config, a change inside a repository that
  sits in an ignored directory, such as a linked worktree, other than an entry added or
  removed at its top level, and changes outside the audited repos. When any check file
  carries the note `note mtime precision: seconds`, say the ignored-file comparison used
  whole-second times, so a same-size rewrite within the same second was not detected. A
  user's own edits to an audited repo during the run would also have tripped the check.
- Forge: which bundles were not queried, and exports' "not in export" keys.
- Test injection: the `_test` key, when present.

### 12. Usage

From `usage.md`, per stage: agents, requested models (the report says "requested",
never "used"), wall-clock, and tokens labeled "task notification, subagent_tokens;
scope not documented", or "not reported", including every Codex call. Any sum is
labeled "sum of reported numbers, not exact".
