# Tiers, roles, and fallbacks

Read this file during Step 1, before the estimate in Step 1.6. It holds the effort tier
table, the estimate rule, the implementer choice, the risk floor, re-evaluation, and the
reviewer and implementer roles with their fallbacks.

## Roles

The reviewers and implementers are keyed by role, not by tier. The tier table below says
which model each stage uses at each tier. `gpt-6-luna` is an implementer model only and is
never a reviewer.

| Role | Default | Fallback when the default is unavailable |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator and primary reviewer | The session's current Claude model (Opus or Fable) | none, the run stops |
| Codex reviewer, `gpt-6.1-sol` | Skill tool, `recode:ask` or `recode:review`, model `gpt-6.1-sol` | Agent tool, model `opus` |
| Codex reviewer, `gpt-6-astra` | Skill tool, `recode:ask` or `recode:review`, model `gpt-6-astra` | Agent tool, model `fable`; on an error from that call, model `opus` |
| Claude reviewer (Step 5, every tier) | Skill tool, `code-review`, at the tier's level; in a worktree run, an Opus subagent for the worktree as `worktree.md` describes, and in Multi-repo mode, an Opus subagent for each additional repository, as `multi-repo.md` describes | none; if the skill is not listed when the stage starts, the run ends in `blocked` |
| Implementer, Codex | Skill tool, `recode:implement`, model per the tier table | Agent tool, model `sonnet` |
| Implementer, Opus | Agent tool model `opus`, at high, xhigh, and max tier, when the Opus criteria apply to the slice | on a tool error from an `opus` call, `sonnet`, and the error is recorded |

Rules for roles:

- Codex model ids are always the full id, `gpt-6.1-sol`, `gpt-6-astra`, or `gpt-6-luna`.
  A bare id such as `sol`, `astra`, or `luna` fails on a ChatGPT account. Pass the full id
  on every Codex call, including `--resume` follow-ups. On every reviewer call, also pass
  `--timeout` from the Codex budget.
- Codex is reached only through the Skill tool, with `recode:ask` for plans and
  questions, `recode:review` for diffs, and `recode:implement` for implementers.
  Never run the `codex` CLI directly.
- An implementer call to `recode:implement` passes `--timeout` in seconds: the smaller
  of the subagent budget and the remaining run budget, capped at 3600, because recode
  refuses a larger value. Log the cap and the value passed in `run.md`. The Codex budget
  does not apply to it. There is no `--resume` for `implement`: every call starts a new
  thread.
- For a reviewer stage at `gpt-6-astra`, at any tier, the fallback tries the `fable` model
  on the Agent tool first. If that call returns an error, use `opus` and record the error.
  Do not detect the session's model. This is for reviewer calls only: a Codex
  implementer's fallback is `sonnet` alone.
- The Claude reviewer is the built-in `code-review` skill, called through the Skill tool
  with the level the tier table names as the first argument, then the range
  `<base-commit>...HEAD` as the target, as the Claude review contract in `SKILL.md` says,
  never `--comment` and never `--fix`. It is a fixed slot beside the Codex slot at every
  tier: it is not a fallback for the Codex reviewer, and nothing falls back to it or
  replaces it. `--no-codex` does not touch it. Its availability is checked only when a
  stage that needs it starts, so plan-only runs do not need it. The Reviewer contract in
  `SKILL.md` gives the call shape and the budget. In a worktree run, and in Multi-repo
  mode for each additional repository, the Claude slot is an Opus subagent, a defined
  substitute for a checkout the skill cannot target, and not a swap.
- An implementer call at model `opus`, through the Agent tool or inside a Workflow, whose
  tool call itself returns an error is rerun with the same prompt at `sonnet`. The slice's
  effective model becomes `sonnet`. Log the error and the swap, and name it in the report
  as an implementer swap. Do not stop the run. This does not cover a permission denial
  (Approval scope, carve-out 3), a call that runs past its subagent timeout (a budget
  expiry), or any reviewer call, whose fallbacks stay as the table lists.
- A fallback swaps one reviewer or one implementer. It never removes a stage. The tier is
  set by the task's risk and does not change because a reviewer is unavailable.
- A fallback reviewer gets the same request text, the same files, and the same required
  reply shape as the Codex reviewer it replaces.
- Fall back to the Claude subagent when `--no-codex` is set, when Codex was found
  unavailable in Step 0.6, or when a Codex call returns `failed` or no status line twice
  in a row. The fallback model is the one the roles table gives: `opus` or `fable` for a
  reviewer, and `sonnet` for an implementer. A Codex implementer call that returns
  `failed` or no status line is retried or swapped only under the preconditions of Step
  4.2.4 in `SKILL.md`, which include the state of the process and the tree. A `refused`
  status is not retried and is not swapped: it ends the run in `blocked` with the
  message, for a reviewer and for an implementer, except an implementer refusal whose
  message contains "implement was not run:", the host's write sandbox, which swaps
  the slice to `sonnet` and marks Codex implementation unavailable for the run (Step
  4.2.4 in `SKILL.md`). A `timeout` status is a budget expiry
  and ends the run in `blocked` with the budget named: the Codex budget for a reviewer,
  the implementer `--timeout` for an implementer.
- Write every swap to the run log with the stage, the reason, and the fallback model. Every
  swap is named in the final report.
- If no reviewer is available for a required stage, the run ends in `blocked`. If the
  orchestrator is unavailable, or an implementer call at `sonnet` errors, the run stops.

"With a trigger" means a risk floor trigger exists for the change: it adds, alters, or
removes an item in the risk floor list, directly or through shared code. It does not mean
the floor raised the tier. The trigger is judged at high tier only, and only two cells
depend on it. For the high tier plan review, the trigger is judged from the Step 1.6 floor
check: a floored high run gets `gpt-6-astra`, a high run that is only cross-cutting gets
`gpt-6.1-sol`. For the high tier final review, a trigger counts when it was present at the
estimate or is present in the diff after Step 4: the run then gets Codex `gpt-6-astra` and
Claude `code-review high`, else Codex `gpt-6.1-sol` and `code-review medium`. A medium run
that rises to high always has a trigger in the diff, so it gets the trigger cell. The
xhigh and max cells no longer depend on the trigger: they are fixed by the tier alone.

Every tier reviews the plan in Step 3 and runs Step 5. Low tier no longer skips it. Every
Step 5 round is both reviewers, Codex and Claude, over the same diff, at every tier. Every
implementer call keeps the per-call subagent timeout (a Codex implementer call the
smaller of that and the remaining run budget, capped at 3600 seconds), Step 4 keeps its cap of 3 rounds per slice, and the run budget still
bounds the whole run. A plan with three slices has three independent round caps, and an
implementer swap adds a call to that slice. `--plan-only` stops at Step 3.6 at every tier.

## Estimate rule

Apply after Step 1. Low, medium, and high are sized from the behavior the change has, not
from how many issues there are. xhigh and max are sized from how many areas that share no
file the change spans, on top of that.

- Low: one file or one function, a clear fix, and none of the risk floor triggers.
- Medium: several files in one area, or one issue with tests, or any doc restructure.
- High: a cross-cutting change inside one deliverable, or any risk floor trigger.
- xhigh: one change whose scope spans several areas of the code that share no file. This
  sets review depth. Slice count is set by the plan at every tier.
- Max: an xhigh-shaped change that also has a risk floor trigger.

Bundling issues does not by itself raise the tier; estimate the bundle as one change. Two
issues that each touch one file in one area are still medium. A bundle is xhigh only when
the change it describes, taken as one change, spans several areas with no shared file.

`--effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max` skips the estimate and forces that tier, subject to
the risk floor below.

Record the estimate, the reason, any floor applied, and any re-evaluation in the run log
and in the final report.

## Implementer choice

At every tier the default implementer is Codex at the tier's model, one call per slice:
`gpt-6-luna` at low, `gpt-6.1-sol` at medium and high, `gpt-6-astra` at xhigh and max.
Choose the implementer per slice in Step 2. At high, xhigh, and max, choose `opus` for a
slice when any of these hold; otherwise keep Codex. At low and medium tier it is always
Codex. `sonnet` is never chosen at the plan: it is the fallback (see Rules for roles).

- the slice carries a risk floor trigger: its change adds, alters, or removes an item in
  the risk floor list
- the slice owns more than eight files, counting files it creates
- the slice adds a new module, type, interface, or rule section that another file in the
  slice, or in another slice, calls, implements, or cites

Record the choice in the plan next to the slice, as "codex" or the criterion that
applied. Log it in the run log when the slice's implementer starts, and list it in the
final report per slice with the reason. The plan reviewer may object to a choice; the
objection is handled like any other. Codex having no network does not change the choice:
see Step 3.7 and Step 4.3 in `SKILL.md`.

The slice's effective model is the chosen model (the tier's Codex model, or `opus`), or
`sonnet` after an implementer swap (see Rules for roles). Every later call for that
slice, in Step 4.3, Step 5.3, and CI repair, uses the effective model. For a Codex slice
each later call is a fresh `recode:implement` call at its effective model, never
resumed, given the findings and the slice's current diff. For an Opus or Sonnet slice,
the agent is continued or fresh, including a fresh agent replacing one that ran inside a
Workflow. The single fix after the Step 4 cap stays the orchestrator's.

## Risk floor

A change is at least high tier if it adds, alters, or removes any of these, whether
directly or through shared code or configuration that they depend on:

- an auth check
- a permission rule
- a schema or a migration
- a row-level security policy
- a data access path
- a public API's signature or behavior

The triggers are about behavior. Editing a file in one of these areas without changing
such behavior does not trigger the floor. Examples are a typo fix in a migrations README,
a comment change in an auth module, or a rename that changes no signature. This is the
incidental-edit exception. When it applies, the final report says why the floor did not.

The floor is `high`. `--effort` cannot lower a task below it. If the user passes
`--effort low` or `--effort medium` for a task the floor covers, refuse the request, state
the reason (which trigger applies), and continue the run at high tier. Do not stop the
run. `--effort xhigh` or `--effort max` is above the floor and is honored.

## Re-evaluation after Step 4

After Step 4, apply the risk floor to the actual diff. This is a floor check only: the
estimate rule is not applied again, so a diff that turned out larger or more independent
than planned does not move the run to xhigh or max. The check has two outputs: whether
the tier rises, and which Step 5 reviewers the run gets.

- If a trigger now exists and the run is below high tier, the run rises to high tier. Log
  the rise and the reason. A run already at high, xhigh, or max tier keeps its tier,
  whatever the diff contains.
- Resolve the Step 5 reviewers from the tier table after this check. Only the high cell
  depends on the diff, in both slots: a high run gets Codex `gpt-6-astra` and Claude
  `code-review high` when a trigger was present at the estimate or is present in the diff,
  else Codex `gpt-6.1-sol` and Claude `code-review medium`. The xhigh and max cells are
  fixed and stand as the table gives them. A medium run that rose to high always has a
  trigger in the diff, so it gets Codex `gpt-6-astra` and Claude `code-review high`.
- Complete Step 5 with those reviewers before Step 6. It stays inside the round caps in the
  budgets. Plan review at Step 3 is not repeated after Step 4, so a run that rose keeps
  the `gpt-6.1-sol` plan review it already had.
- The tier never falls after Step 4 because the diff turned out smaller than planned, and
  the Step 5 reviewers never weaken: at high, a trigger present at the estimate counts
  even if the diff no longer shows it.
- The estimate, its reason, any floor applied, the re-evaluation, and the Step 5 reviewers
  it resolved go in the final report.
