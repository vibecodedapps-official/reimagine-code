# PR body and issue comment templates

Read this file at Step 7.2, before opening the PR. Fill in every section from the plan, the
run log, and the checks. Write "none" for an empty section.

## PR body

```
## What changed

Per input:

- <input: issue #n, file <path>, or ad-hoc description>: <what changed and where, in a few
  lines. State status: complete or partial. If partial, say what is left.>

## Drift corrections

<For each input whose text had drifted from the code, one line: what the issue said, what
the code showed, and the plan that followed. Write "none" when nothing drifted.>

## Decisions for the reviewer

<Decisions a reviewer needs to understand the shipped change: design choices, options
rejected and why, behavior a reader could take for a bug. Not a log of the run. When
this run opens the PR for a continued branch and the branch has earlier commits beyond
the default branch (Step 7.2), one sentence says the branch carries that many earlier
commits this run did not review.>

## Checks not run

<Each check that could not run locally, with the reason. Each check deferred to CI, by job
name. Each check failing at baseline, with the baseline run as evidence. "none" if all ran
and passed.>

## Related pull requests

<"none" in a single-repo run. In Multi-repo mode, "pending" when the PR is first opened,
then one link per sibling PR after the `gh pr edit` pass.>

## Closes

<One line per input, see the rules below.>
```

## Closing reference rules

Decide completion per input after implementation, the reviews the tier requires, and Step 6.
The criteria come from the plan.

- `Closes #n` only when every acceptance criterion for that issue is confirmed met.
- `Refs #n` in every other case: a criterion not met, not confirmed, or an input marked
  partial or blocked. Post a status comment on the issue (see below).
- A file input or an ad-hoc description has no issue to close. List it under "What changed"
  and write no closing line for it.
- In Multi-repo mode an issue is closed only by the PR in its own repository, with
  `Closes #n`. Every other PR of the run cites that issue as `Refs <owner>/<repo>#n`.
- Use one line per issue, for example `Closes #12` on one line and `Refs #14` on the next,
  so the platform links each one. Do not join them.

## Continued PR comment

With `continue` and an open PR, Step 7.2 posts the body as one comment on that PR, not as
a body edit. A comment cannot close an issue, and the PR's own body decides what merging
closes. Use the PR body template with these changes.

- Replace the "Closes" section with an "Issues" section. Write one line per issue, `#n:
  complete` or `#n: partial`, with what is left when partial. Write no `Closes` or `Refs`
  line. Write an issue of another repository as `<owner>/<repo>#n`.
- End the "Issues" section with the line: The PR's own body decides what merging this PR
  closes.

## Issue status comment

Post at Step 7.4, once per source issue, after the PR is open. Post it for `Closes` issues
too, so the issue records the evidence. Never post one before the plan is final.

```
Status from the ccx run <run-id>: <complete | partial | blocked>

PR: <the PR in this issue's repository, then each sibling PR>

Criteria:
- <criterion>: <met | not met | not confirmed>. <evidence: test name, check result, or
  file and behavior>

Not done:
- <what remains and why, or "nothing">

Deferred:
- <item and reason, or "nothing">
```

Rules for the comment:

- State partial completion plainly. Do not say "done" for a `Refs` issue.
- Cite evidence for each criterion. Do not repeat a claim from a subagent without checking it.
- Do not open new issues. List follow-up work under "Deferred" and in the final report.
- Keep the text free of run-internal paths and artifacts that are not committed.
