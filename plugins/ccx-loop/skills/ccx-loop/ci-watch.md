# CI watch

Read this file at Step 7.3 of `SKILL.md`. It holds Step 7.3 items 1 to 4: what CI to
read, which workflows apply, what passes, and how to poll. Item 5, CI repair, stays in
`SKILL.md`.

   1. Read these with `gh`, all readable with read access. If any read fails, CI cannot be
      verified: end in `blocked`, naming the failed read. Never treat a failed read as "nothing
      is required". The one exception is the rules read below: when it returns HTTP 403 with
      a message asking to upgrade to GitHub Pro or to make the repository public, GitHub
      offers no rulesets for this repository, so none apply. Record that answer in `run.md`
      and the report, take the required checks from branch protection alone, and expect no
      required workflows. Any other failure of the rules read still blocks.
      - Required checks: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/<base> --jq .protection` gives
        `required_status_checks` (`contexts`, and `checks` with `app_id`). `<base>` is the
        base branch the run recorded for the PR: the default branch for a PR this run
        opened, and the base branch Step 0.2 recorded with `continue`. Do not read the
        `/protection` endpoint, which returns 404 without admin rights.
        `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/<base>?per_page=100" --paginate`
        gives the active rules, including
        organization rulesets: its `required_status_checks` rules add required checks and its
        `workflows` rules name required workflows by file path and repository. A required check
        is a name and, when set, the app that must report it.
      - The PR: `gh pr view <n> --json headRefOid,mergeable,baseRefName` for the head SHA,
        merge state, and base branch, and `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n> --jq
        .merge_commit_sha` for the test merge commit. Read the PR view again at every
        poll. A missing `merge_commit_sha` is read again on the next poll. A base branch
        other than `<base>` means the PR was retargeted, so the required checks read above
        no longer apply: end in `blocked` at once, naming both branches.
        Record the commit SHA this run last pushed for each PR. At every poll and again
        before declaring CI green or not applicable, compare that SHA with the remote
        head from `git ls-remote --heads <remote> refs/heads/<branch>` and with
        `headRefOid`. A remote-head mismatch ends in `blocked`, naming both SHAs.
        A stale `headRefOid` within the 2 minutes after a push that item 4 leaves unjudged
        is pending; after those 2 minutes it is a mismatch.
        Judge results only when `headRefOid` equals the commit this run last pushed.
      - Results, for the head commit and the test merge commit:
        `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha>/check-runs?filter=latest&per_page=100"`
        (page on when `total_count` exceeds 100) and
        `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/<sha>/status?per_page=100" --paginate`,
        which gives the latest status per
        context. Only the latest result counts: the latest status per context, and the latest
        attempt of each check run within its own check suite, so same-named checks from
        different workflows are judged separately. Earlier attempts are report history only.
      - Required workflows:
        `gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs?head_sha=<head sha>&per_page=100" --paginate`,
        comparing each run's `path` and repository with the rule's workflow file path and
        `repository_id`.
      Read every page of active rules, statuses, and workflow runs before evaluating CI.
      Read both commits again after every push.
   2. A workflow applies to the PR when it triggers on pull requests, its `branches`,
      `branches-ignore`, `paths`, and `paths-ignore` filters match the PR's base branch and
      changed files, and its `types` filter, when present, includes the event the watched head
      commit produced: `opened` for the first watch after the PR is created, `synchronize`
      for the first watch when the run continued a branch whose PR was already open, and
      after a CI repair push to the open PR. A filter that cannot be evaluated with
      confidence counts as a match. A workflow triggered by `pull_request` (not
      `pull_request_target`) does not apply when the PR head commit's message carries a skip
      instruction: `[skip ci]`, `[ci skip]`, `[no ci]`, `[skip actions]`, `[actions skip]`, or
      a `skip-checks:true` or `skip-checks: true` trailer. The report names each workflow a
      skip instruction made not applicable. A required check stays required either way.
      Expected deferred checks are a separate set: every check Step 6 deferred to CI whose
      workflow applies, matched by job name. A deferred check whose workflow does not apply is
      named in the report as not triggered, with the filter that excluded it, unless it is
      also a required check.
   3. A result passes when it is `success`, `neutral`, or `skipped`. Any other finished
      result is a failure: `failure`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, `stale`, or
      a commit status of `failure` or `error`. The gated commit is the test merge commit when
      it has any status or check run, else the head commit, because GitHub judges required
      checks on the test merge commit when it has a status. A required check is met when its
      latest result on the gated commit passes, from the required app when one is set, and,
      when the name exists both as a check run and as a status, both pass. A required app is
      verified from a check run's app. A commit status carries no app, so when a required check
      names an app and only a status carries that name, its source cannot be verified: end in
      `blocked` at once, naming the check, rather than risk `done` while GitHub rejects the
      source. A required workflow is met when its latest run for the head commit, matched by
      the rule's workflow file path and repository, passes. A match that cannot be confirmed
      counts as unmet and is named in the report.
   4. Poll at about 30 second intervals, checking the run budget each time. CI is not
      judged until 2 minutes after the push, measured from the time recorded right after
      the push returned. If `mergeable` is `CONFLICTING`, `pull_request` workflows do not
      run: end in `blocked` at once, naming the conflict. CI is green when every required
      check and required workflow is met, every expected deferred check has passed on the
      head commit, every applicable workflow has reported at least one check on the head
      commit, and every latest result on either commit has finished and passed. That is
      stricter than GitHub's merge gate, on purpose: the loop publishes only fully green
      work, and the report says so when an optional check blocked it. Anything unmet or
      not yet reported is pending until the CI budget expires, then `blocked`. A failure
      in a latest result is a CI failure. CI is not applicable only when there are no
      required checks or workflows, no workflow applies, no deferred check is expected,
      and no result has appeared on either commit within 2 minutes of the push; the report
      says so. A result that appears on either commit keeps the watch open until it
      finishes.
